1932828,"(Recasts with quotes from executives) By Anshuman Daga SINGAPORE, Oct 19 () - Singapore-based private equity firm Kendall Court struck a deal to invest $55 million in Mandaya Medical International Pte Ltd (MMI), which is building a 420-bed private hospital in Jakarta to expand into the countrys healthcare services sector. Kendall Court will own a majority stake in the Indonesian company by buying preference shares, the two firms said in a joint statement on Friday. Executives from Kendall Court and MMI said Indonesias healthcare sector was growing rapidly, with hospital capacity falling far short of demand. In 2014, Indonesia - the worlds fourth most populous country with 260 million people - rolled out an ambitious five-year goal of establishing universal health coverage. There are more people getting onto the healthcare system, more people requiring medical services, more drugs are required, more hospital beds are required, Chris Chia, managing partner at Kendall Court told  in an interview. Public hospitals are all at breakneck capacity, said Chia, adding that private hospitals were working with the government to cater to public patients. MMI, part of the Selaras Group conglomerate which is focused on hospitality, healthcare and property, already operates a 218-bed hospital in Karawang, about 50 km (30 miles) east of Jakarta. The Indonesian group plans to invest about $95 million to build two more hospitals in Indonesia as part of its expansion strategy. Siloam International Hospitals Tbk PT and Mitra Keluarga Karyasehat Tbk PT are among the biggest hospital operators in Indonesia. MMI Director Benedictus Widaja said MMI will build a network of hospitals focused on cardio-vascular, neuroscience and cancer specialties. The new 70,000-square metre general hospital in Jakarta would be among the citys biggest hospitals and start operations at the end of 2019, said Widaja. New local rules allowing ASEAN investors to acquire a maximum stake of 70 percent in general hospitals in Indonesia, were encouraging investors to pump money in the industry, said Chia, a former banker, who co-founded Kendall Court in 2004. Kendall Court counts several institutional and high net worth investors among its backers and has deployed and managed over $600 million in Southeast Asia in various sectors.

113901711,"Elwood, Ind.  An Indiana superintendent was arrested last week for insurance fraud, identity deception and official misconduct. But Casey Smitherman said she believed she was doing the right thing at the time. 'I would really like to go back and revisit that moment and change it, but I can't,' she said. Two weeks ago, she took a 15-year-old student who didn't have health insurance to a medical clinic. He had a very sore throat, so she passed him off as her son and paid for the clinic visit and prescription with her own health insurance. Casey Smitherman  'It's hard not to want to help all of our kids,' Smitherman said. In her school district, 78 percent of the kids qualify for free or reduced-cost lunches, so groups of teachers have identified struggling students to help with food, clothing and mentoring. Last Saturday, Smitherman told the police what she'd done and turned herself in. The police alerted prosecutor Rodney Cummings. 'I think there have to be some consequences, but they shouldn't be career jeopardizing. I think there's a way to take care of that without destroying her career, because her motives were good,' Cummings said. 'I'm not justifying what I did but I also think it's hard to look in the face of that sick kid and so until you're in that boat you don't know,' Smitherman said. She is now in what's called a diversion program that will allow the charges to be dropped if there are not further arrests in the coming year.","

1919615,"WASHINGTON () - There are no signs that a blockade of Yemens ports by a Saudi-led military coalition has eased to allow aid to reach communities increasingly at risk of starvation, the head of the U.S. governments aid agency said on Tuesday. USAID administrator Mark Green called on the Saudi-led military coalition to open Yemens ports and for Yemens Houthis to cease firing to allow food and medical supplies to flow to tens of thousands of Yemenis caught in the fighting. Green was speaking after the U.S. announced another $130 million in emergency food aid for Yemen, bringing U.S. assistance to nearly $768 million since October 2016. The new funds includes nearly $84 million in U.S. food aid and $46 million in emergency disaster assistance. Unfortunately I cant tell you there has been an easing of the blockade, Green told . Were trying to signal with this announcement that were ready to respond to this humanitarian catastrophe. Green said he was deeply concerned on so many fronts about the crisis in Yemen, but in particular the failure to get fuel into the country so people have access to clean water. That means a number of communities are either without clean water or will be very shortly, and in both cases that is a terrible concern from the cholera perspective and the survival perspective, he added. The U.N.s coordinator for Yemen, Jamie McGoldrick, said on Monday the blockade has been eased but the situation remained dire with some 8.4 million people a step away from famine in Yemen. A Saudi-led military coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi movement blockaded ports last month after a missile was fired toward Riyadh. Washington last week warned Saudi Arabia that concern in Congress over the humanitarian situation in Yemen could affect U.S. assistance to allies in the Saudi-led coalition, including the U.S. refueling of coalition jets and some intelligence sharing.","

5085257,"() More than 24 hours after three men rampaged through central London killing seven and injuring 48, little is known about the attackers or the victims of the assault -- the third terror attack on British soil in less than three months. Details are being kept closely under wraps, in stark contrast to last month's Manchester bombing, when photos and information from the investigation were repeatedly leaked to the media. There has been no official information on the identity of any of the three attackers. This comes despite a series of police raids and upwards of 12 arrests across the capital, including two new raids on Monday morning at addresses in Newham and Barking in east London. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Sunday night, although they provided no evidence for their involvement or details of the attack. Seven people have been confirmed dead by police but only one of the victims has been identified so far, Canadian woman Chrissy Archibald who moved to Europe to be with her fiance. Another 36 men and women are currently in hospital, 21 of whom are in a critical condition, according to emergency services. A memorial is planned for 6pm local time Monday, in the capital's Potters Field Park to commemorate those affected, as the city continues to digest its second terrorist attack in two months London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the city's 'anger and grief' was indescribable. 'We are all shocked and angry today but this is our city. We will never let these cowards win and we will never be cowed by terrorism,' he said in a statement.

Three men drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge late Saturday night, before abandoning the vehicle at nearby Borough Market. They then got out of the car and began stabbing people at random until police arrived and shot all three dead. An 'unprecedented' number of rounds had been fired at the three attackers by police, who ended their rampage just eight minutes after the London Bridge incident was reported. The three attackers were wearing what appeared to be suicide belt, which later turned out to be fake. Rowley said it was probable they had worn them to ensure they were killed by police. Parts of London near where the attack took place are still cordoned off on Monday morning, police said, leaving some residents unable to access their homes. 'We advise residents they will not be able to access properties until cordon is lifted. Thank you for your patience and cooperation,' police tweeted.

79070087,"Steve Mnuchin is viewed as less protectionist than President Donald Trump and some other West Wing advisers including Stephen Bannon. | GETTY Mnuchin looks to Wall Street to fill key Treasury roles NEW YORK -- Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin, likely to be confirmed by the Senate on Monday, is reaching into the Republican establishment and Wall Street to fill out senior leadership roles in his department. Senior Goldman Sachs banker Jim Donovan is under strong consideration for deputy Treasury secretary and could serve as Mnuchins number two if confirmed by the Senate, people familiar with the matter said. Justin Muzinich, a former Morgan Stanley banker now at Muzinich & Co., is likely to take a senior position possibly as undersecretary for domestic finance or counselor, the people said. The counselor position would not require Senate confirmation. Story Continued Below Economist David Malpass, a veteran of the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, is expected to be nominated by President Trump to serve as undersecretary for international affairs. A White House spokesperson and a spokesperson for Mnuchin did not immediately return requests for comment on Sunday night. None of the selections are final. The trio would round out the top level at Treasury, which has been operating for weeks with limited staff including Adam Szubin, an Obama and George W. Bush administration holdover, as acting secretary. All three are well known both on Wall Street and in Washington. Malpass, who was an economic adviser to Trump during the 2016 campaign, also served as chief economist at Bear Stearns. Donovan, a Goldman partner and managing director, is close to Mitt Romney and served as one of the 2012 GOP nominees top fundraisers. He was also a top fundraiser and economic adviser for Jeb Bush in the 2016 campaign. He joined Goldman in 1993 and covered major clients in both investment banking and investment management. He made partner in 2000 and worked with then co-presidents John Thain and John Thornton on broader strategy for Goldman as a whole. For the last eight years, Donovan has also served as a professor of corporate strategy at the University of Virginia law school. Donovan would be the latest Goldman alum to join a Trump White House team that already includes several former executives of the bank including Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and senior Trump advisers Dina Powell and Stephen Bannon. The selection of Donovan, Muzinich and Malpass for the high-profile Treasury positions will likely draw fresh criticism from the left  and some on the populist right -- because of their association with Wall Street. Trump regularly criticized the financial industry during his populist run to the White House, singling out Goldman for specific criticisms. Trumps final ad of the campaign portrayed Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein as a sinister force of globalism. He criticized Ted Cruzs wife for her work at Goldman and his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, for her paid speeches to the powerhouse Wall Street bank. But for corporate executives and investors worried about the erratic nature of the Trump White House and the presidents inclination toward protectionism and a harsh approach to immigration, all three selections are likely to be viewed with relief. Both Malpass and Muzinich, who served as a top policy adviser to Jeb Bushs campaign, are well known both on Wall Street and among establishment Republicans in Washington. The Treasury Department is likely to play a key role as Trump develops a corporate and individual tax reform package with Republicans in Congress. Treasury also handles economic sanctions and currency issues and works with other departments on trade initiatives that are central to Trumps presidency. Mnuchin is viewed as less protectionist than Trump and some other West Wing advisers including Bannon. He and Cohn both come from more internationalist and trade-friendly backgrounds. The hope among many CEOs and financial industry executives is that they will help steer Trump away from trade wars while helping implement a policy of tax cuts, infrastructure investment and reduced regulations that could boost economic growth and continue a stock market rally that began following Trumps election.","

39117603,"Labour leader would have to find substantial sum to honour commitment made in his leadership race to scrap fees Just over half a million young people enter higher education in the UK each year, so Jeremy Corbyn would have to find a substantial sum of money  about GBP10bn a year  to make good on the pledge he made when running for Labour leader to abolish tuition fees and bring back maintenance grants. That is lower than the headline cost of multiplying the number of undergraduates by the GBP9,000-a-year tuition fees because the policy only applies to English students, and young people from households earning less than GBP25,000 a year are exempt. Until recently they also received top-up grants, which are now top-up loans. The devolved parliament in Edinburgh and the Welsh assembly have their own education budgets and have developed different ways of funding higher education. University officials agree that GBP10bn would pay for both policies. The figure breaks down into around GBP8bn to replace fees for students in England and GBP2bn to bring back maintenance grants. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, has not ruled out Labour making good on the pledge  although Labour has yet to spell out how it would be funded. It is unlikely that it could be paid for by raising corporation tax to 26%, since much of that revenue is already earmarked, including GBP8bn for schools, educational maintenance grants and free school meals for all primary school pupils. That increase to 26%, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, could bring in GBP19bn, but that total is likely to decline as firms relocate to lower tax locations and invest less  meaning lower growth. Critics of the proposal to scrap tuition fees argue that the biggest winners would be middle and higher income families who currently pay the most under what is a means-tested scheme. Tuition fees have been deemed necessary by governments of both left and right in order to pay for the increase in student numbers. In 1960, only 5% of young people entered higher education; today the figure is about 40%, with around 400,000 new English undergraduates each year. The Labour leader said last year that his plan contrasted with a Tory move to allow approved universities to increase their tuition fees, which he said was a tax on learning.","

4964787,"() The city of Seattle has filed a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's executive order on so-called sanctuary cities, calling it 'fatally ambiguous' and unconstitutional. 'The Order is premised on a misreading of federal statutory law and departs dramatically from settled constitutional principles,' the lawsuit, filed by Seattle Mayor Ed Murray and City Attorney Pete Holmes, states. The suit challenges the legality of the executive order, signed by Trump in late January, that takes aim at so-called 'sanctuary' jurisdictions by threatening to withhold federal grants. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a news briefing the order will 'strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants.' A sanctuary city is a broad term that refers to cities or states with policies in place that limit involvement in federal immigration enforcement. The Trump administration has argued that cities should collect the citizenship status of its residents and report that information to federal officials. Suit claims order 'unclear' But many large cities, including Seattle, limit the collection of citizenship information by its local law enforcement, which is not actively required by federal law. These cities also largely do not honor requests from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to detain individuals beyond what is allowed by criminal proceedings. These cities argue that immigrants are more willing to cooperate with law enforcement and seek health assistance if they do not fear they may be deported when doing so. The suit has two main thrusts. First, it argues, Seattle is not in violation of the relevant federal statute, known as Section 1373. And second, the executive order's meaning is unclear and it is unconstitutional, as it violates the 10th amendment. 'It uses terms that are vague and not defined, does not spell out the particular enforcement objectives of the Secretary and Attorney General, and does not describe in an intelligible manner the federal Executive Branch's understanding of the requirements purportedly imposed by Section 1373,' the lawsuit reads. Mayor: City will stand with immigrants, refugees The order also violates the Spending Clause, the lawsuit argues, and is causing 'immediate harm' to Seattle by hampering its budget process. About $55 million of Seattle's 2017 operating expenses comes from federal funding, and more funding is dedicated to longer-term capital investments, the city said. In a statement, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said the city will continue to stand with its immigrant and refugee populations. 'Seattle will not be bullied by this White House or this administration and today we are taking legal action against President Trump's unconstitutional order,' he said. The lawsuit names Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly as defendants.","

38895458,"Counsellors say defence of cardinal in the media has been distressing for people affected by child sexual abuse A specialist counselling service that supports victims of childhood sexual abuse has been inundated with calls since the conviction of Cardinal George Pell, with many survivors saying they have been traumatised by high-profile support for the disgraced prelate. The president of the Blue Knot Foundation, Cathy Kezelman, said demand for the childhood trauma service spiked when a suppression order lifted on 26 February, revealing Pell was guilty of five charges, including sexually penetrating a 13-year-old choirboy. Its been so challenging, as weve had double the normal amount of calls since then, Kezelman said. Some people are acutely distressed. The story is playing out in public in such a way that its impossible, almost, to avoid it. A significant amount of the reporting defended the cardinal and attempted to discredit the victims abuse. Cardinal George Pell's conviction: the questions that remain Read more People have their own personal relationship with Cardinal Pell, but I dont know how people can connect their friendship with someone as to whether they are innocent or not, Kezelman said. Australias child sexual abuse royal commission found many child abusers were intelligent, liked and respected. It also found survivors took, on average, 23.9 years to tell someone about their abuse, and men often took longer to disclose than women. Some victims never disclose. Pells complainant disclosed as an adult, about 18 years after the attacks. Kezelman said despite the commissions work, a lot of myths had been spread about abusers and victims by the media in discrediting Pells conviction. She urged those struggling to seek professional help. People are feeling very triggered and are in need of being held and feeling safe, Kezelman said. They should know [that] any reaction is valid and all these things are normal in the context of very public trauma stories playing out, especially when what is playing out is the victims struggle, despite a trial, to be believed. Assoc Prof Tim Moore is the deputy director of the Australian Centre for Child Protection at the University of South Australia. He said he was concerned about the messages some of media reporting of Pells trial were sending to young people who were being abused now. We need the public to realise kids are still at risk and being abused, and we need to give kids enough information to come to an adult, Moore said. My fear with some of the public discourse is that kids experiencing abuse are being told its not OK to share their experience, that they wont be believed. We need to empower them, and ensure they are safe. But instead the message from some seems to be: even if you come forward and go through a gruelling experience like attending court, the public is still not always going to give you the support you deserve. Judy Courtins law firm represents victims of child sexual abuse. She said she had been inundated by phone calls and emails from her clients, whom she described as incredibly distressed. She said this trauma was a direct result of the commentary in support of Pell. The inconsistencies of George Pell's defenders just display their power | Richard Cooke Read more Some of the commentators arent being very intelligent and all theyre showing is how little they know and understand about how child sex crimes are committed and the impact, Courtin said. I think theyre displaying an absolute arrogance. And they have opened up wounds, big time. One of her clients had since attempted suicide, she said. Where was the church for this man last week? she said. Where is the church for this man now? Instead of helping this man, they treat him as the enemy and fight him to the death  almost literally. Such high-profile figures supporting Pell, saying hes still innocent, is terribly harmful. Its saying to people like this young man, what you say is not worth a thing. Chrissie Foster, whose daughters Emma and Katie suffered sexual abuse at the hands of a priest over several years, was angered by the level of criticism of Pells trial from people who were not there or who could not have read transcripts. In 1998 one of her daughters received a letter signed by Pell apologising for the abuse she had suffered. But a separate letter from the churchs compensation scheme, established by Pell, said the $50,000 in compensation offered to her should provide an alternative to litigation that will otherwise be strenuously defended. Foster remains a tireless advocate for victims, and was present during Pells trial in November and December. She had a message for survivors struggling amid the support for Pell. Dont let the Catholic church or the priesthood take any more of your life than they already have, she said.

4565900,"It's been more than three decades since Virginia State Trooper Johnny Rush Bowman was stabbed to death at his home outside the nations capital, but federal investigators are hopeful a new reward -- and a plea from Bowman's daughter -- could finally lead authorities to the officer's killer. Bowman was killed when he answered a doorbell in the early-morning hours of Aug. 19, 1984 at his home in Manassas, Va., located about 30 miles outside of Washington D.C. Bowman was stabbed between 40 to 45 times by an unknown assailant as his young daughter, wife, brother, and sister-in-law were in the home with him. The FBI on Tuesday announced the agency is now offering a $50,000 reward for information that can lead to a break in the case, the only unsolved killing of a Virginia State Trooper in the commonwealths history. This push for information is nationwide, said First Sergeant Michael B. Elliott with the Virginia State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation. With as much time that has passed, people have potentially moved to other parts of the country. If they have knowledge, I hope they will do the right thing and come forward. The attacker or attackers left behind sunglasses, a wig, and a construction hard hat. Even with advances in DNA testing and other forensic technology, investigators have not been able to track down any substantial leads after reexamining evidence from the crime scene. The killing of the 31-year-old off-duty officer spurred one of the most extensive and costly murder investigations in the history of the Virginia State Police, with more than 3,000 people in 41 states interviewed by police, the Washington Post reported at the time. The FBI said it became involved in the case because the murder is considered a line-of-duty death. Bowman's daughter, who was two years old at the time, was awakened in the early-morning attack that ended her father's life. Now an officer with the Manassas Police Department, Nikki Bowman said in a video released by the FBI that her father's memory inspired her to pursue a career in law enforcement and drives her need to find resolution in his case. 'Thirty-four years is a long time of waiting. My life is a constant struggle. Every day is hard, and I think its time for the roles to be reversed,' she says. 'Their life should be hard. You need to own up to what youve done. I should be able to live happily after this but I can't do that without answers.' CONNECTICUT MAN ARRESTED IN 2014 MURDER OF MOTHER OF 2 AFTER HE REPORTEDLY CONFESSES TO MURDER Nikki Bowman, who is not part of the investigative team, says that she will continue to 'advocate the case' while encouraging anyone who may know about what happened to her father to come forward. 'I would find it very hard to believe that theres not someone or multiple people that know what happened that day,' Bowman says in the video. 'Whether it was by word of mouth, they were there, someone that was there told them, but somebody knows something.' In the video, the officer said she remains hopeful someone will finally speak up. 'Im thankful to everybody thats still pursuing the case and taking time to continue investigating, continue following leads, trying to find more leads,' she says. 'At the same time, 34 years is a long time, and each year that passes it gets a little bit more difficult. I just want answers.'

4804029,"() Another US Navy warship accident in Asian waters took place early Monday, the fourth this year. The US Navy will be trying to figure out whether this spurt of warship accidents are singular incidents or reflect a 'systemic' problem that needs to be fixed, retired Rear Adm. John Kirby,  military and diplomatic analyst, told 's 'New Day.' 'That will certainly be I think accelerated in the wake of what happened here to the McCain. They will take a harder look. There's absolutely no question that they will want to make sure that they don't have some larger issue going on culturally or procedurally inside the Navy.' The following are the details of the four accidents: USS John S. McCain The Navy's 7th Fleet said the USS John S. McCain collided with the merchant vessel Alnic MC while the destroyer was making its way to a port in Singapore. The collision was reported at 5:24 am local time, east of the Malacca Strait, one of the world's most congested shipping routes. Ten US soldiers are missing. Significant hull damage occurred on the McCain, with flooding in berthing compartments as well as machinery and communication rooms. 'There's probably a thousand different ways how something like this can happen,' Kirby told 'New Day.' 'I know it sounds a little strange for me to say that, but it's unusual for ships to collide, although I know we have had several here in recent months.' In addition to the missing sailors, the Navy said five were injured in the collision. Four of those were flown to a hospital in Singapore with injuries that were not considered life-threatening, the Navy said. USS Fitzgerald The USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship off the coast of Japan in June, resulting in the deaths of seven US sailors. The Fitzgerald will be transported to the United States for repairs. The bow of the cargo ship directly struck the commander's cabin, according to the Navy's report detailing the immediate aftermath of the collision. The commanding officer, executive officer and senior noncommissioned officer of the USS Fitzgerald have been removed from their duties for cause A Navy report on the immediate aftermath provides a harrowing account of US sailors attempting to escape a rapidly flooding sleeping area that filled with water within minutes after the cargo ship's bow tore a hole in the side of the Fitzgerald. Of the 35 sailors in the sleeping area at the time of the collision, 28 were able to escape, but the remaining seven sailors died. USS Champlain In May, a South Korean fishing boat struck the USS Lake Champlain, while the Navy warship was conducting operations in international waters near the Korean Peninsula, the Navy said. No injuries were reported. The 60- to 70-foot-long fishing vessel collided with the Lake Champlain -- a 568-foot Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser that has been with the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson strike group. The fishing vessel crew later said it didn't have a radio and didn't hear the radio calls from the Navy, according to a Navy official. USS Antietam In late January, the guided-missile cruiser USS Antietam ran aground while trying to anchor in Tokyo Bay. The ship damaged its propellers and spilled hydraulic oil into the water off the coast of Japan. The incident did not result in any injuries to US or Japanese personnel, but the discharge of up to 1,100 gallons of hydraulic oil prompted environmental concerns.","

4617013,"Climate change could be to blame for the collapse of bird populations in the desert along the Nevada-California border, scientists said. The number of bird species has fallen by an average of 43 percent over the past century at survey sites across an area larger than New York state, according to a new study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. The study shows almost a third of species are less common and widespread now than they once were throughout the region. The study's authors, Steven Beissinger and Kelly Iknayan, point to less hospitable conditions in the Mojave Desert as the probable cause. 'California deserts have already experienced quite a bit of drying and warming because of climate change, and this might be enough to push birds over the edge,' said Iknayan, who conducted the research for her doctoral thesis at UC Berkeley. 'It seems like we are losing part of the desert ecosystem.' 'The Mojave Desert is now nearly half empty of birds,' said Beissinger, a UC Berkeley professor of environmental science, policy and management. 'This appears to be a new baseline, and we don't know if it's stable or if it will continue to decline.' The researchers spent three years searching for birds at 61 locations on both sides of the border, including survey sites in the Spring Mountains and at Desert National Wildlife Refuge, just outside of Las Vegas, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported . They also surveyed sites across Death Valley and Joshua Tree national parks and Mojave National Preserve, Iknayan revisited the same sites UC Berkeley biologist Joseph Grinnell and his colleagues surveyed between 1908 and 1947. Iknayan and Beissinger found that areas with reduced rainfall lost more birds species than sites that remained wetter. Their findings were published earlier this month in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Researchers are calling it a collapse because it has occurred across the entire desert bird community.

115928682,"Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga urged his supporters to skip work on Monday to protest what he charged were rigged elections that gave victory to President Uhuru Kenyatta. The government denounced violent demonstrations as unlawful and urged Kenyans to return to their jobs.. Odinga spoke on Sunday to a cheering crowd in Nairobi's Kibera slum, an opposition stronghold and a frequent scene of clashes between stone-throwing protesters and police firing live ammunition and tear gas since the Aug. 8 election in which President Uhuru Kenyatta was declared the winner. Odinga's defiance fueled continuing uncertainty in Kenya, an East African economic hub whose reputation for stability has been shaken by election violence and court challenges in the past. 'There is no work until Tuesday, when we will announce the next step,' said Odinga, who previously claimed that last week's vote was rigged. Kenya's election commission said its process was fair, and international observers praised its handling of the election in this country of 45 million people. The opposition leader's announcement left Kenyans wondering whether Odinga could press his case that there was vote-tampering and even escalate the situation by calling for protests. One of his deputies previously ruled out the option of going to court, recalling Odinga's unsuccessful legal challenge after he lost the 2013 election. Some analysts believe it is unlikely that he would effectively acknowledge defeat at this stage. Odinga also lost a 2007 election, which was followed by ethnic-fueled violence in which more than 1,000 people were killed. He was made prime minister in a power-sharing agreement aimed at defusing tension. Opposition areas, including Kibera, another Nairobi slum called Mathare and the city of Kisumu, were mostly quiet on Sunday morning, with many people attending church services and police patrolling some streets. However, protesters threw stones and police lobbed tear gas, according to Associated Press journalists on the scene. Also Sunday, Odinga visited the mother of a 9-year-old daughter who was killed by a stray bullet during clashes between police and protesters in the Mathare slum on Saturday. Police gunfire has killed at least 24 people since the election, according to the state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, which monitors government institutions. However police denied the report on Sunday, saying police have killed six 'criminals' who were looting, rioting and attacking police officers in the past two days. There was 'a plot to kill our supporters,' Odinga said in his brief remarks to supporters. On Twitter, he said people should observe a day of mourning on Monday for 'fallen patriots.' However, presidential spokesman Manoah Esipisu said Sunday that the protests were violent and unlawful, and that any peaceful protests are a constitutional right and would be protected by police. 'But sadly, we have seen violent protests, in which property has been damaged, and lives have been endangered,' Esipisu said. 'The violent protests are unlawful, so let me be perfectly clear here: The police will not tolerate breaches of the peace; instead, they will protect the lives and property of Kenyans; and they will restore law and order.'  Associated Press journalists Tom Odula and Jerome Delay in Nairobi, Kenya, contributed to this report.","

4359043,"Israel commits weather theft by cunningly manipulating clouds to prevent rain falling over Iran, an Iranian general has alleged. Brigadier General Gholam Reza Jalali, head of Irans Civil Defence Organisation, said that the changing climate and drought in Iran is suspect and a coalescence of malign, anti-Iran forces are to blame, according to the semi-official ISNA news agency. Foreign interference is suspected to have played a role in climate change, General Jalali insisted, adding that an Iranian scientific study confirms the claim. Israel and another country in the region have joint teams which work to ensure clouds entering Iranian skies are unable to release rain, he said. General Jalali cited a survey carried out over the past four years covering the climate of high altitudes stretching from Afghanistan to the Mediterranean Sea. He said that above 7200 feet all mountainous areas are covered in snow, except Iran. The head of Irans meteorological service Ahad Vazife struck a more sceptical note, saying General Jalali probably has documents of which I am not aware, but on the basis of meteorological knowledge, it is not possible for a country to steal snow or clouds. Iran has suffered a prolonged drought, and this is a global trend that does not apply only to Iran, Vazife reportedly said. This is not the first time outside forces have been accused of seeking to affect the weather in the Islamic republic. Former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2011 accused Western countries of devising plans to cause drought in Iran. He claimed European countries used special equipment to force clouds to dump their water on their continent. Western countries have designed plans to cause drought in certain areas of the world, including Iran, Mr Ahmadinejad said. According to reports on climate, whose accuracy has been verified, European countries are using special equipment to force clouds to dump their water on their continent, he said. By doing so, they prevent rain clouds from reaching regional countries, including Iran, Mr Ahmadinejad charged.","

17951638,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Rockets were seen in the sky above Ashkelon in Israel The death toll is mounting on both sides after three days of cross-border violence between Israel and militants on the Gaza strip. The most intense clashes in years have so far left at least four Israelis and 23 Palestinians dead. The Israeli army says more than 600 rockets have been fired into Israeli territory since Saturday, while it has hit 320 targets in response. Parts of the international community, including the UN, have called for calm. Reports on Sunday night suggest the UN, Qatar and Egypt are trying to broker a ceasefire. On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had ordered the military to 'continue its massive strikes on terror elements' in Gaza. Israel has said its air defence has intercepted more than 150 rockets so far. Mr Netanyahu says the country's forces around the strip would be 'stepped up with tank, artillery and infantry forces'. As rockets continue to fall in Israel, all schools within 40km (25 miles) of the Gaza strip have been closed and some shelters have opened to the public. What do we know about casualties? Four people have so far died from the violence in Israel: A 58-year-old man died from injuries in a rocket strike on a house in Ashkelon on Saturday night A worker died in Ashkelon on Sunday when a rocket hit a factory Another man, 67, was killed when his car was apparently struck by an anti-tank missile A fourth person, who was in his early 20s, was killed in the southern city of Ashdod Image copyright EPA Image caption The funeral for one Israeli casualty, Moshe Agadi, was held on Sunday The Gaza Health Ministry says 23 Palestinians have died across the weekend. Most of the deaths came on Sunday. The Islamic Jihad group said seven of the dead were its members. Civilians, including a 12-year-old boy and two pregnant women were also among those reportedly killed. Israel has contested the account of the death of one woman and her 14-month-old niece on Saturday. They blamed their deaths on a Palestinian rocket that fell short of its target. On Sunday, the Israeli military admitted a targeted assassination of a Hamas commander named Hamed Hamdan al-Khodari - sharing a video of the apparent moment they hit his car. The sites Israel says has destroyed include a multi-storey building in Gaza City, which it said included Hamas intelligence offices. Turkey said its state news agency Anadolu had an office there. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called Israeli strikes on civilians 'a crime against humanity'. On Sunday night, Hamas leader Ismail Haniya said in a statement that 'returning to a state of calm is possible' if Israel committed to a 'complete ceasefire'. Image copyright AFP Image caption A car, apparently belonging to Hamas militant, was one of the sites targeted by Israel on Sunday How did the latest violence develop? It began on Friday, during protests in Gaza against the blockade of the area - which Israel says is needed to stop weapons reaching militants. A Palestinian gunman shot and wounded two Israeli soldiers at the boundary fence. Israel retaliated with an air strike that killed two militants. The rocket barrage from Gaza began on Saturday morning. Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system shot down dozens of the rockets, but a number of homes in Israeli towns and villages were hit. How does the flare-up in violence compare? It is the one of the most surges in violence since the conflict of July and August 2014. In that year, Israel launched a ground offensive on Gaza following the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers. The conflict resulted in the death of 67 Israeli soldiers. Hamas and its allies launched more than 4,500 rocket strikes that killed six civilians in Israel. On the Palestinian side, 2,251 people, including 1,462 civilians, were killed in the seven-week conflict, according to the UN. Since then, Palestinian militants have continued to carry out sporadic strikes on Israel. Image copyright Reuters Image caption People are seen crouching amid a siren warning in the Israeli city of Ashkelon In a previous wave this year, in March, several rockets were fired into southern Israel, triggering raids on Gaza by the Israeli air force. No fatalities were reported on either side. In early April a ceasefire was brokered by Egypt, but Hamas and allied militant groups later accused Israel of violating its terms. What has the reaction been? Nickolay Mladenov, the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, has condemned the recent violence and said the UN is working with both sides to calm the violence. In a statement, UN Chief Antonio Guterres has condemned 'in the strongest terms' rockets being launched into Israel. 'He urges all parties to exercise maximum restraint, immediately de-escalate and return to the understandings of the past few months,' the statement added. Speaking on Fox News on Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Israelis have 'every right to defend themselves' from rocket attacks. 'I hope we can return to the ceasefire that had been in place for weeks and had been holding significantly before this,' he added. The European Union on Sunday called for rocket fire to 'stop immediately'. Iran's foreign minister, condemned what he labelled as Israel's 'savage' attacks on Gaza, while also hitting out at 'unlimited American support' of Israel. Save the Children has said it has had to suspend all but essential programs in the Gaza strip. Jeremy Stoner, their Middle East Regional Director, said the group were 'deeply alarmed' by rapidly rising casualties on both sides, and called for de-escalation.","

52982060,"At Least 24 Memphis Police Officers Hurt In Protests After Deadly Shooting Enlarge this image toggle caption Adrian Sainz/AP Adrian Sainz/AP Updated at 9:30 a.m. ET At least 24 Memphis Police Department officers were injured during a large protest Wednesday night, Mayor Jim Strickland says. The violence erupted after officers of the U.S. Marshals Service shot and killed Brandon Webber, 20. The shooting occurred around 7 p.m. local time, as officers from the U.S. Marshals Service  Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force tried to take a man into custody. When the officers approached the man, law enforcement officials said, he was getting into his car in the Frayser community in northern Memphis, Tenn. That man was Webber, according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the case. The agency says Webber was 'wanted on multiple warrants.' When the officers tried to stop Webber, 'he reportedly rammed his vehicle into the officers' vehicles multiple times before exiting with a weapon,' the TBI says. 'The officers fired striking and killing the individual,' according to the TBI. Local residents began to gather in the street, looking for answers, reports local TV news Fox 13. Shelby County Commissioner Tami Sawyer was among the first officials to identify the slain man publicly. She also said the local community has a reason to distrust the police. 'I was in Frayser tonight because Brandon Webber was shot 16-20 times in his family's front yard on the same day as the Pulse nightclub shooting anniversary,' Sawyer says in a tweet, 'and on the same day that the DA chose not to charge another police officer for murdering a civilian.' In another post, Sawyer says, 'Don't judge Frayser without asking a community how it feels to mourn their youth over and over again.' 'No officers were injured' in that initial encounter, according to the TBI. But the fatal shooting touched off outrage in Frayser, a predominantly black area in northern Memphis. The U.S. Marshals asked Memphis police for help, and officers who responded initially came to assist with traffic. As residents gathered in the street near where the shooting occurred, police formed a human wall across the asphalt. Officers repeatedly ordered crowds of people off the streets. Within hours, however, violence broke out and police deployed riot shields. The situation escalated as people in the crowd began throwing rocks and bricks at officers, according to Memphis police. Around 10 p.m. local time, police began using tear gas against the protesters, according to the Daily Memphian. Six wounded officers were taken to the hospital, Strickland says, adding that at least two journalists were also hurt and 'multiple' police cars were vandalized. 'A concrete wall outside a business was torn down. The windows were broken out at fire station 31,' Strickland says on Facebook. 'Let me be clear  the aggression shown towards our officers and deputies tonight was unwarranted.'","

4404418,"The editorial board of the Washington Post has declared that President Trump is complicit for Hurricane Florence because of his views on climate change. The massive storm has not made landfall yet, but the Post published a column on Wednesday headlined, Another hurricane is about to batter our coast. Trump is complicit. The piece also notes that Trump has given good advice when issuing hurricane warnings via his Twitter feed before it launched an attack on the president. When it comes to extreme weather, Mr. Trump is complicit. He plays down humans role in increasing the risks, and he continues to dismantle efforts to address those risks. It is hard to attribute any single weather event to climate change. But there is no reasonable doubt that humans are priming the Earths systems to produce disasters, the editorial board wrote. Billionaire Jeff Bezos paper then quotes a climate researcher who said that previous hurricanes would not have produced so much rain without human-induced climate change and Florence is another indication of global warming. With depressingly ironic timing, the Trump administration announced Tuesday a plan to roll back federal rules on methane, a potent greenhouse gas that is the main component in natural gas. Drillers and transporters of the fuel were supposed to be more careful about letting it waft into the atmosphere, which is nothing more than rank resource waste that also harms the environment, the Posts editorial board wrote. The Trump administration has now attacked all three pillars of President Barack Obamas climate-change plan. The piece concluded: The president has cemented the GOPs legacy as one of reaction and reality denial. Sadly, few in his party appear to care. Conservative strategist Chris Barron told  that the mainstream media finds new ways to embarrass themselves and further erode Americans confidence in them on a daily basis. The media wont give Trump credit for the economy but they will blame him for a hurricane. You cant make this stuff up.  Conservative strategist Chris Barron This column is so absurd it should be coming from The Onion not the Washington Post. To the extent that climate change is happening, it is a global phenomenon that has been occurring for decades and decades, Barron said. The media wont give Trump credit for the economy but they will blame him for a hurricane. You cant make this stuff up. The Category 4 hurricane remains strong as it continues its approach to the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph, the National Hurricane Center said in its 8 a.m. advisory. Florence was 530 miles south east of Cape Fear, North Carolina and moving west northwest at 17 mph. According to  Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean, Florence could stall upon reaching the Carolina coast and make a slight shift south once it makes landfall, becoming a major flooding event. Hurricane Florence will likely be another tragedy that will affect millions of Americans and it's disgusting when folks in the media will try to exploit it to attack the president.'  Mediaite columnist Joseph Wulfsohn In addition to the hurricane-strength winds blowing ashore Friday, Florence has the potential to bring a storm surge upwards of six feet in parts of the coastline, including up to 13 feet from Cape Fear north to Cape Lookout. Hurricane Florence will likely be another tragedy that will affect millions of Americans and it's disgusting when folks in the media will try to exploit it to attack the president, Mediaite columnist Joseph Wulfsohn told . On Wednesday morning, President Trump urged caution to residents refusing to evacuate coastal towns, saying Florence is bigger than anticipated. Hurricane Florence is looking bigger than anticipated, Trump tweeted. It will be arriving soon. FEMA, First Responders and Law Enforcement are supplied and ready. Be safe! Trump also released a video urging residents in affected areas to get out of its way.' On Tuesday, the Washington Post published a different anti-Trump piece by MSNBC anchor Joe Scarborough, who wrote that Trump is harming the dream of America more than any foreign adversary ever could. The Morning Joe namesake was criticized for tweeting that Trump is damaging the dream of America more than any terrorist attack ever could to promote the column, which was published on the 17th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people.

55373296,"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. President Donald Trump's escalating trade war is supposed to be about protecting American jobs  but the uncertainty it's creating is forcing some businesses to shift production overseas and cut back on hiring. On Monday, Milwaukee-based motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson announced it would be moving the production of vehicles bound for Europe to international facilities to avoid what it estimated would be $100 million in annual tariffs. The move was in reaction to the E.U.'s raising tariffs on U.S.-produced motorcycles from 6 percent to 31 percent. The tariffs were in retaliation for Trump's levying tariffs on imported aluminum and steel. 'Harley-Davidson maintains a strong commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing, which is valued by riders globally,' the company said in a statement. 'Increasing international production to alleviate the E.U. tariff burden is not the companys preference, but represents the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the E.U. and maintain a viable business in Europe.' Unlike previous tariff arrangements, this one has had little in the way of planning. That's knocked businesses on their heels and left them wondering whether the president's tariffs are legitimate policy or merely political bluster. 'We're in a whole new world,' P. Welles Orr, an international trade adviser who worked as a trade representative under George H.W. Bush, told . 'Companies left and right are getting caught off guard,' Craig Kennison, an auto industry analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co, told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel this week. It's hard to run a business when the rules keep changing. Harley isn't the only company having to reassess its corporate model on the fly. CEOs surveyed by the influential Business Roundtable lobby said this month they've reduced their hiring plans for the year by 13 percent and trimmed their spending expectations by 4 percent. Trump escalated the trade war tensions Sunday, threatening in a tweet to hit back harder at any country that has placed tariffs on American goods, demanding they 'remove those Barriers & Tariffs or be met with more than Reciprocity by the U.S.A.' 'This administration is about shock and awe  and in trade policy that is clearly by design,' Orr said. 'To this administration that chaos is a good thing. It's got people up in arms and that's its purpose.' For now, it's a chaos that's adding uncertainty and confusion to the lives and job prospects of the very workers who may have elected him.","

1667232,"KHARTOUM () - At least four protesters were killed and many injured by gunfire in the Sudanese city of Omdurman on Thursday, opposition medics said, as hundreds of thousands took to the streets to pile pressure on the countrys military rulers. People demonstrate against the killing of protesting children, who were shot dead when security forces broke up a student protest in Khartoum, Sudan August 1, 2019. /Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah Organizers had called for a million-person march in cities across Sudan in response to the killing of young protesters in El-Obeid, southwest of the capital Khartoum, earlier this week. Sudan has been gripped by months of political turmoil that climaxed in the army overthrowing long-time leader Omar al-Bashir in April. Protesters have kept up their rallies since then, pressing the army to hand over to civilians, accusing the security services of violence and decrying the shortages and economic hardships that triggered the unrest in the first place. Thursdays killings, reported by the Central Committee of Sudan Doctors, one of the main protest groups, came as opposition leaders said there had been some progress in talks with the military on a deal to form a new government after Bashirs ousting. Despite signing a deal in July which secured a three-year transition period and a joint sovereign council with a rotating leadership, talks over the wording of a constitutional declaration on the changes have stumbled. The agreement is really now just around the corner, Satea al-Hajj, a leader in the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) coalition of opposition groups, said in a press conference in Khartoum on Thursday. Negotiations over the declaration began again late on Thursday night. ITS TOO BAD The opposition had demanded that members of the sovereign council, which is intended to lead the country until elections are held, should not be granted blanket immunity from prosecution for past crimes. But FFC leaders said on Thursday they had agreed that they could be granted only procedural immunity - meaning top officials could be tried with the permission of two-thirds of the legislative council. The opposition leaders said both sides also agreed another key point, reaffirming that the parties included in the FFC would have 67% of the legislative council while the rest will be granted to other opposition and political groups. Sudans ruling military council did not immediately confirm the details of the agreements. In Omdurman, across the Nile from Khartoum, protesters chanted its too bad, its too bad, we dont have an army, expressing anger at the army for not protecting protesters. Footage posted on social media also showed protests breaking out in El-Obeid, the state capital of North Kordofan state, and Wad Medani, the state capital of Jazeera state, southeast of the capital on the Blue Nile. The FFC has accused military and paramilitary forces of firing on the high school pupils as they protested over bread and fuel shortages in El-Obeid on Monday. The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), the main protest group and a leading voice in the FFC, accused the military of failing to protect civilians and of either being complicit in or neglecting to protect against roadblocks preventing the masses from achieving the goals of the revolution. A senior army commander said a security force assigned to guard a bank was responsible for killing children protesting near there, the official SUNA news agency reported on Thursday. The bank guards were a government security force. Slideshow (4 Images) Opposition groups have also accused the main paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces, of killing scores of protesters since Bashir was ousted and the RSFs role remains a point of contention. The FFC said on Thursday that the RSF should be merged into the armed forces, a proposal opposed by Sudans ruling generals, said al-Hajj.","
