56697,Breitbart,"VIDEO: Hero German Shepherd Shot, Beaten Defending Teenager from Home Invaders","A two-year-old German Shepherd went above and beyond to protect his owner after he took bullets and blows defending his best friend from home invaders.
The 16-year-old owner, Javier Mercado, hid in his closet with his dog Rex as burglars ransacked his Des Moines, Iowa, home Wednesday, KWCH reported.
“As soon as he heard the window shatter, he ran downstairs full charge,” Mercado told KOMO. “And then I just heard a bunch of barking and struggling, and then one of the guys screaming, ‘The dog! The dog bit me! Get the dog!’”
Rex, sensing there was danger in the house, ran downstairs to confront the burglars—who ruthlessly beat him.
As the burglars continued to pilfer through the house, they approached the room where the teen was hiding. Although Rex had little strength left in him, he pounced on the burglars.
“I think if it wasn’t for him, I probably wouldn’t be standing here today,” Mercado said.
The hero German Shepherd was shot three times trying to take down the burglars.
Once the burglars heard police sirens, they fled the scene. When the officers arrived at the home, they rushed Rex to a local veterinarian, expecting the worst because they thought the animal was dead.
Doctors gave the dog pain medication, wound care, and antibiotics while placing him in intensive care. The German Shepherd is now recovering and in stable condition.
A family member set up a GoFundMe page to raise money to pay for Rex’s veterinary bills. The page raised $58,161 as of Sunday afternoon—more than five times the page’s $10,000 goal.",RIGHT

The “Trump Bump” went bust. And it happened as President Donald Trump tested out new midterm material – even accusing Democrats of “treason” for not applauding during his State of the Union address.
The president is clearly ready for midterm politics. But as the split-screen of a market freefall and presidential attacks showed, the political landscape may not be ready for him – not with signs of economic uncertainty, and standoffs and showdowns dominating headlines.
There is obvious political risk in running on a booming stock market, since it makes it harder not to own a slide. There is also risk in campaigning against Democrats as “un-American,” to quote the president, particularly as the Russia investigations swirl.
The markets are in the midst of a wild ride that will no doubt stabilize. But the president is making the political ride wilder for all involved – allies as well as enemies.
The RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks
It is hard to have your cake and eat it too.
It is hard to tell voters that your memo has merit, if you don’t let the other side offer theirs.
It is hard to say that some selected facts, chosen by Republican staff, were both vital to the public and not a security threat, but that other facts, laid out by Democratic aides, are the opposite.
Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee seemed to acknowledge all this last night, when they voted to unseal the Democrats’ rebuttal memo, written in response to the GOP one they released last week.
The Democratic memo reportedly adds additional intelligence, outlining other details about how the FBI obtained warrants at the beginning stages of the Russia investigation. The assumption is that it pushes back against the idea FBI investigators abused their powers.

Senate Intelligence Committee Chair, Richard Burr, R-N.C., says he is fine with the declassification of the Democrats’ memo, too. So with the thumbs up from Burr and House Intel, the question now is: What will the president do?
He does not have a strong track record of encouraging voters to read all sides or consider all options.
The TIP with John Verhovek
For close to 15 years Devin Nunes has been a virtually unheard-of congressman from central California who had coasted to re-election victories during his time on Capitol Hill.
Now Nunes, thrust into the national spotlight in his role as the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, is becoming a prime target for Democrats eager to pick up his seat – believing Nunes has become a toxic political figure.

Enter Andrew Janz, democrat and Deputy District Attorney in Fresno County, California, who is hoping to become the prosecutor who ends Nunes' decade-and-a-half congressional career.
""We have a saying in the DA's office: When the facts aren't on your side you argue the law, when the law isn't on your side you argue the facts, and when the facts and the law aren’t on your side, take your shoe off and bang it on the table,"" Janz told ABC News in a phone interview yesterday, ""This is exactly what we're seeing Devin Nunes do right now.""
Janz, who more than doubled his fundraising totals this quarter to more than $130,000, according to Federal Election Commission data, has made Nunes' escapades a key part of his case against the Republican, and pushed back on the notion that the issue is a non-factor in the district.
""I haven't had any interactions with people that have said that,"" Janz said, ""Devin can keep going with his political stunts and we're going to keep raising money, and we're going to hold him accountable using that money in November.""

164540,Reuters,UK consumers ramp up borrowing again after winter chill,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s consumers picked up the pace of their borrowing in April, according to data that could reassure the Bank of England that the economy is ready for another interest rate hike after a cold winter slump.

Also on Thursday, surveys showed consumers turned a bit more confident this month, possibly reflecting an easing of a Brexit-related squeeze on their spending power, and companies were more upbeat too.
“The figures will give the Monetary Policy Committee increased confidence in their assessment that the Q1 slowdown was just a blip,” Andrew Wishart, an economist with consultancy Capital Economics, said.
“The figures chime with other signs that consumer spending growth is starting to strengthen, such as strong retail sales in April. And the rise in consumer confidence in May suggests that consumer credit growth will continue to grow strongly.”
Britain’s economy, which has slowed sharply since voters decided in mid-2016 to leave the European Union, nearly ground to a halt in the first three months of 2018, when the country was hit by unusually cold weather.
The slowdown prompted the BoE to hold off from raising interest rates this month. It noted the sharp fall in consumer borrowing when it explained why it kept rates on hold.
Thursday’s data from the BoE showed consumer credit jumped by a bigger-than-expected 1.832 billion pounds, the strongest rise since November 2016, up from an increase of only 425 million pounds in March.
Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected consumer lending to show a net increase of 1.3 billion pounds.
The annual growth rate in consumer lending edged up to 8.8 percent from 8.6 percent in March, its slowest increase since November 2015, the BoE said.
A surge in consumer credit peaked in late 2016 when it was growing by 11 percent a year.
Since then, the BoE has urged banks to scale back risky lending, and consumers have felt the pinch from higher inflation after the Brexit vote and weak wage growth.
But there are signs that the squeeze on spending power is easing. Inflation has eased in recent months and wage growth is slowly picking up speed.
The monthly GfK consumer confidence survey showed households felt more upbeat about their personal finances although the remained largely pessimistic about the economy ahead of Brexit next March.
In contrast to the signs of a pickup among consumers, Britain’s housing market remains in the doldrums.
Prices rose by 2.4 percent in the 12 months to May, down from rates of around 5 percent shortly before the referendum, mortgage lender Nationwide said.
The BoE said the number of mortgages approved for house purchase edged down to 62,455 in April from 62,802 in March, below economists’ forecasts of 63,000 in the Reuters poll.",CENTER

Investigate the investigators, Trump says
• President Trump has intensified his frequent threats to intervene in the special counsel inquiry, demanding that the Justice Department look into whether the department or the F.B.I. had “infiltrated or surveilled” his campaign.
The president has said that an F.B.I. informant who was sent to talk to his campaign aides was actually a spy dispatched for political purposes. In fact, the F.B.I. sent the informant only after receiving evidence that the advisers had suspicious contacts linked to Russia.
Legal experts said Mr. Trump’s call for an investigation had little precedent and could force a clash with the Justice Department reminiscent of the one involving Richard Nixon during Watergate.
• Also on Sunday, Mr. Trump’s lawyer Rudolph Giuliani said the special counsel, Robert Mueller, hoped to finish by Sept. 1 the investigation into whether the president obstructed the Russia inquiry. A spokesman for the special counsel’s office declined to comment.",LEFT
40999,The Guardian,"Schools are not the answer to childhood obesity epidemic, study shows","Obesity Schools are not the answer to childhood obesity epidemic, study shows Researchers say much wider action is needed after a major programme in primary schools in the West Midlands was shown to have made no difference to obesity levels Children at more than 50 primary schools in the West Midlands were given a year of extra physical activity sessions and a healthy eating programme. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo
Childhood obesity programmes in schools are not the answer to the epidemic affecting the UK, according to researchers who say much wider local and national action is needed, including curbs on the advertising of junk food.
A major obesity programme introduced into more than 50 primary schools in the West Midlands has failed to have any significant effect on children’s weight. Children were given a year of extra physical activity sessions, a healthy eating programme and cookery workshops with their parents. Families were invited to activity events, including sessions run by Aston Villa football club.
But at the end of 30 months, there was no difference in obesity between those children who took part and those who did not.
The government’s childhood obesity plan, launched from Downing Street in January last year, placed great emphasis on increasing sport and other activity in schools. A number of school-based obesity programmes have been introduced around the country, focusing on increasing physical activity and improving children’s diet in school.
But, says the team from the University of Birmingham’s Institute of Applied Health Research, the negative results from their large study published in the British Medical Journal are in line with what has been found elsewhere; schools may have a role to play but can only be part of the answer to the obesity problem.
“We need to look at ways that we can really engage communities in this agenda, change our local environment and look at how national policies can support diet and physical activity,” said Miranda Pallan, one of the team.
Children, she said “are at the centre of lots of layers of influence”. For primary school children, parents and the wider family are key. “They function within their family. Decisions on what to eat and what they do are determined by their family.”
Adults, who may themselves be obese, are influenced by many different things. Local initiatives in communities can help but national policies on food and the environment are also vital.
The government is tackling sugar levels in soft drinks and foods. “There are some good things in the government’s plan but we would argue that there need to be further measures and there are things like advertising restrictions that would be very good to see,” Pallan said.
“If anything what our research highlights is that although schools are vitally important, they can’t do it alone. We need many, many approaches. Each of those will make a marginal difference. We need to look at the whole picture of the causes and tackle each of those areas.”
The institute created and introduced an ambitious programme called West Midlands ActiVe lifestyle and healthy Eating in School children, dubbed Waves. The programme included extra daily physical activity in schools, a physical activity and healthy eating programme in conjunction with local sporting heroes, regular information to parents about local physical activity opportunities, and workshops on healthy cooking for families at schools.
About 1,400 children aged six and seven took part in the trial. At the start of the trial, height and weight was recorded for each of them, along with other measurements relating to body fat, diet and physical activity levels.
The researchers found no significant difference in weight status and no meaningful effect on body fat measurements, diet or physical activity levels at 15 and 30 months in children taking part in the programme, compared with those not taking part.
They suggest that “nudge” interventions, such as using financial incentives to prompt healthier behaviour, merit further investigation. But they conclude that school based motivational, educational approaches “are unlikely to halt the childhood obesity epidemic.”
Prof Melissa Wake, paediatrician and obesity expert from Victoria, Australia, says in a linked editorial that it is time to step back and take stock. The important findings of the trial “could perhaps help break the cycle of policymakers continuing with ineffective educational preventive approaches that can never hope to greatly impact on the obesity epidemic.”",LEFT
55072,The New York Times,States Mull ‘Red Flag’ Gun Seizures from People Deemed Dangerous,"“It’s fair to say that everyone, law enforcement included, is learning how this law might work — in the process of using it,” said Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine and director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the Sacramento campus of the University of California, Davis.
Connecticut was the first state in the nation to pass such a statute in 1999, in response to a mass shooting at a state lottery office. What followed surprised some officials there: Almost no one used the law. For years, it was relegated to the back shelf of law enforcement, with only a handful of cases a year.
The pace of cases began to quicken, Connecticut statistics show, after high-profile shootings occurred elsewhere, starting in 2007 with the deaths of 33 people on the campus of Virginia Tech. Advocates of red flag laws said they provided important protections, particularly as people became increasingly aware of the risks of mass shootings.

Still, even states with the laws have not avoided such shootings. The gunman who killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012 had access to guns, though people who knew him said he had shown troubling signs before the attack.
“This is a country with hundreds of millions of guns in circulation, and that fact imposes real constraints on what policy can achieve and on what kind of policy makes sense,” said Ramesh Ponnuru, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group. No one, Mr. Ponnuru added, should expect any one law to fix everything. “Realism is the right attitude,” he said.
Many Republicans oppose red flag laws, and the National Rifle Association has argued that a judge’s order to seize a person’s weapon may violate Second Amendment rights when no crime has been committed.

But law enforcement officials who have embraced red flag laws say that they allow the authorities to step in before something catastrophic occurs. The removals are temporary, these officials stress, meaning that guns are returned to people no longer deemed dangerous.
The laws allow weapons to be seized for a brief time — typically two or three weeks — after which a petitioner, usually a police agency, must go back to court to let a judge decide whether the gun owner’s behavior amounts to a threat to himself or others and whether the weapons should be held longer. Some states, including New York and Texas, already allow guns to be taken from mental health patients deemed dangerous, but red flag laws hinge on outward behavior — a person’s statements and actions regardless of medical diagnosis.
“The reason I like gun violence restraining orders as an option is that we can use them even if the person hasn’t been convicted of a crime,” said Mara W. Elliott, the San Diego city attorney. California’s measure, patterned after Connecticut’s, took effect in 2016, and late last year, Ms. Elliott assigned an assistant city attorney to pursue gun seizure cases full time, one of the first cities in the nation to take such aggressive action.
So far, the office has pursued 10 cases, Ms. Elliott said, and officials there have seen circumstances involving more intimate situations than they had expected. Prompted by calls to the police, who then asked the city attorney to intervene under the new law, the authorities removed guns from Alzheimer’s patients, alcoholics and people accused of domestic abuse.
Since Connecticut passed its law, the state has seen 1,519 cases, about two-thirds of them since 2012. California’s far newer law resulted in 86 cases in its first year. And Washington’s superior courts have held about 65 hearings under the law since it was approved by voters in 2016.
Red flag laws have evolved, too. Connecticut and Indiana, which passed its law in 2005 after the murder of an Indianapolis police officer, allow only law enforcement agencies to bring petitions for temporary gun removal. Newer measures, in California, Oregon and Washington, allow family members to bring such petitions to judges as well.

The effectiveness of the statutes has depended on the level of communication between the public and law enforcement agencies, according to social and health policy researchers who have studied the laws. In some places, they said, residents have been far more willing to report troubling behavior than in others. And in some communities, law enforcement agencies are more familiar with the technical intricacies of applying the red flag laws than they are in others. Even in the states that have had the laws longer, like Indiana, state officials have said that many residents and police officers are unaware of the tools they have.
Curtis T. Hill Jr., the Republican attorney general of Indiana, on Wednesday took the unusual step of reminding his colleagues around the state that the provision exists.
“Indiana’s ‘Red Flag Law’ is a common-sense measure that in no way inhibits the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens,” Mr. Hill said in a statement. “This useful provision is not as well-known, even among law enforcement, as one might expect. That’s why this week we are distributing a public safety advisory raising awareness of the law and urging police and prosecutors to make full use of it as we work together to protect all Hoosiers.”",LEFT
165267,ABC News,North Koreans to meet Trump; deliver letter from leader,"A top aide to Kim Jong Un will make a rare visit to Washington Friday to hand a letter from the North Korean leader to President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said after reporting ""good progress"" in talks between the two sides to revive an on-again, off-again nuclear summit.
""I am confident we are moving in the right direction,"" Pompeo told reporters at a news conference in New York after meeting Thursday with former North Korean military intelligence chief Kim Yong Chol. ""Our two countries face a pivotal moment in our relationship, and it would be nothing short of tragic to let this opportunity go to waste.""
He would not say that the summit is a definite go for Singapore on June 12 and could not say if that decision would be made after Trump reads Kim Jong Un's letter. However, his comments were the most positive from any U.S. official since Trump abruptly canceled the meeting last week after belligerent statements from the North.
The two countries, eying the first summit between the U.S. and the North after six decades of hostility, have also been holding negotiations in Singapore and the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
Early Thursday, Trump told reporters ""we are doing very well"" with North Korea. He added there may even need to be a second or third summit meeting to reach a deal on North Korean denuclearization but still hedged, saying ""maybe we'll have none.""
Kim Yong Chol is the highest-ranking North Korean official to visit the U.S. in 18 years, and his trip to the White House will be a highly symbolic sign of easing tensions after fears of war escalated amid North Korean nuclear and missile tests last year.
Pompeo, the former CIA chief who has traveled to North Korea and met with Kim Jong Un twice in the past two months, said he believed the country's leaders are ""contemplating a path forward where they can make a strategic shift, one that their country has not been prepared to make before.""
He tweeted from New York: ""Good progress today during our meetings"" with Kim and his team. Yet he also said at his news conference that difficult work remains including hurdles that may appear to be insurmountable as negotiations progress on the U.S. demand for North Korea's complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization.
""We will push forward to test the proposition that we can achieve that outcome,"" he said.
Pompeo spoke after meeting with Kim Yong Chol for a little more than two hours at the residence of the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. The talks had been expected to be held in two sessions, one in the morning and one in the early afternoon, and had not been expected to conclude until 1:30 p.m. Instead, the two men wrapped up at 11:25 a.m.
Pompeo said they finished everything they needed to address in the morning session. Immediately afterward, he tweeted that he had had substantive talks on the priorities for the potential summit. Pompeo was accompanied by Andrew Kim, the head of a CIA unit assigned to work on North Korea, and Mark Lambert, the head of the State Department's Korea desk.
""Our secretary of state is having very good meetings,"" Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews before departing on a trip to Texas. He said of the North Koreans, ""I believe they will be coming down to Washington on Friday. A letter being delivered to me from Kim Jong Un. It is very important to them.""
""It is all a process,"" he said of arranging the summit. ""Hopefully we will have a meeting on the 12th.""
Despite the upbeat messaging in the United States, Kim Jong Un, in a meeting with Russia's foreign minister on Thursday, complained about the U.S. trying to spread its influence in the region, a comment that may complicate the summit plans. ""As we move to adjust to the political situation in the face of U.S. hegemonism, I am willing to exchange detailed and in-depth opinions with your leadership and hope to do so moving forward,"" Kim told Sergey Lavrov.
North Korea's flurry of diplomatic activity following an increase in nuclear weapons and missile tests in 2017 suggests that Kim is eager for sanctions relief to build his economy and for the international legitimacy a summit with Trump would provide. But there are lingering doubts on whether he will ever fully relinquish his nuclear arsenal, which he may see as his only guarantee of survival in a region surrounded by enemies.
Trump views a summit as a legacy-defining opportunity to make a nuclear deal, but he has left the world guessing since canceling the meeting last week in an open letter to Kim that complained of the North's ""tremendous anger and open hostility."" North Korea's conciliatory response to that letter appears to have put the summit back on track.
Kim Yong Chol is the most senior North Korean visitor to the United States since Vice Marshal Jo Myong Rok visited Washington in 2000 to meet President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. That was the last time the two sides, which are technically at war, attempted to arrange a leadership summit. It was an effort that ultimately failed as Clinton's time in office ran out, and relations turned sour again after George W. Bush took office in early 2001 with a tough policy on the North.
Kim Yong Chol, vice chairman of the North Korean ruling party's central committee, was allowed into the United States despite being on a U.S. sanctions list, and North Korean officials are not normally allowed to travel outside the New York area.
The North Korean mission at the United Nations did not respond to an email seeking comment Thursday, and phone calls were not answered.

56683,Fox News,"Teen survivor, father of Parkland victim call for change after Florida school massacre","A survivor of the Florida high school massacre and a father whose daughter was killed called for wide-reaching changes to school safety in an interview Sunday with Fox News.
Delaney Tarr, a senior at the school, has been one of the most prominent student activists calling for changes to gun laws, a ban on certain weapons and improved care for the mentally ill since a shooter slaughtered 17 people at the Parkland high school on Valentine’s Day.
“We need to address the failures that have created a situation like horrible situation like this. All of the things that have failed us, all of the systems that have failed us,” she said on “Fox News Sunday.” “I also believe we need to make it harder for people to access guns when they are not mentally stable, when they are young, when they are not in a place where they should be owning a weapon like this.”
Seventeen people were killed in the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland by alleged teen gunman, Nikolas Cruz, who used an AR-15 and who had a history of emotional problems, according to investigators.
One of the victims’ fathers, Andrew Pollack, whose daughter, Meadow, died in the shooting, spoke about the need to make change now: “The new norm has to be our kids are safe in the school. This can’t happen again, I can’t let it happen to another kid in another state.”
He told Fox News' Chris Wallace: “I want to tell every governor in every other state, they need to be proactive right now. They need to get a bill in place and we’re going to put all America together, work with these governors to protect our schools. We can’t have another shooting in this country. I can’t live with it. This has to stop with Parkland, and my daughter’s death can’t be in vain. It has to be the last one.”
Cruz was arrested and charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder.
Pollack said that he has been making his grief actionable. “It’s rough, I have my moments you know. It’s like a wave of emotions,” he said about the fire that drives him now. “I can’t explain it, I could walk through flames right now, there’s nothing I can’t do.”
Tarr has been one of the most vocal advocates for change since the shooting, but she knows first and foremost she’s a student.
“It’s very daunting to imagine going back to a place that just two weeks prior held such horrors, and it’s scary because I don’t know if I am going to be safe there, but I know that I have to,” she said about returning to school. “I know now more than ever I’m proud of who I am, and I feel like I need that sense of normalcy because it’s, like, I can’t even be a high schooler anymore.”",RIGHT

Updated at 5:51 p.m. ET
The welfare reform package proposed by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega that set off days of deadly violence has been canceled, according to Reuters:
""In an address on national television, Ortega said the board of Nicaragua's social security system had voted to revoke the measures that were approved last week. The protests have killed at least seven people and injured hundreds more.""
Our original post continues:
Violent anti-government protests in Nicaragua continue for a fifth day, and show no signs of slowing down. A local human rights group, the Nicaraguan Human Rights Office (Cenidh), says at least 25 people have been killed. President Daniel Ortega's forces are accused of using live rounds to quell the demonstrations.
The protests were triggered Wednesday by a sweeping pension reform package that increases contributions for workers and employer, but lowers overall benefits.
The protests have been partly driven by students in the capital of Managua, but have rippled to at least 10 cities across the country.
In the coastal city of Bluefield, a journalist broadcasting on Facebook Live was reportedly shot in the head and killed. Angel Gahona was talking about a broken ATM machine when a gunshot is heard and his body slumps to the ground. The video, which has been widely circulated on social media seems to have poured fuel on the protests.
Ortega has been in office since 2007. This is his fourth term as president, and the protests are widely seen as his biggest challenge yet.
But in remarks Saturday, Ortega seemed to further enrage Nicaraguans by saying the protesters were being politically manipulated; and pointed to the reforms as only being a proposal, and that he was open to negotiations with the business community.
The business community however, which is widely seen as an ally to the government, released a statement saying it would not sit down until freedom is speech is restored and police violence stops.
The BBC reports that independent TV stations have been taken off the air after broadcasting the protests live.

In Managua, protesters are reportedly looting dozens of businesses and have also toppled a tree of life sculpture that was erected as part of the First Lady and Vice President Rosario Murillo's beautification initiative. The toppling of the sculpture seen as a purposeful reprimand of Murillo.

Mollie Hemingway in The Federalist:
“There is nothing about Trump now that suggests his mental state is any different or worse or dangerous than when voters elected him, or when they first encountered him on gossip pages and in reality television decades ago.”
Ms. Hemingway notes that while some critics of President Trump have suggested using the 25th Amendment to overturn election results they were not expecting or not happy with, the debate has been reignited with the publication of Michael Wolff’s book, “Fire and Fury.” Any conversation about the president’s mental fitness, she argues, is merely an attempt by the opposition to undo the democratic will of the American people.

Jonathan S. Tobin in National Review:
“Doing or saying something stupid is not the same thing as mental incapacity. If it were, no president would ever have escaped eviction from office on those grounds.”
Mr. Tobin has no shortage of harsh words for Mr. Trump and his personality. A lack of “presidential temperament,” according to Mr. Tobin, does not preclude Mr. Trump from “making decisions and often getting them right.” The 25th Amendment, he adds, “was intended to provide for a replacement when a president couldn’t serve, not to dump a man whose behavior offends the sensibilities of the educated class.” Read more »

David Frum in The Atlantic:
“Trump may imagine that he’s Michael Corleone, the tough and canny rightful heir — or even Sonny Corleone, the terrifyingly violent but at least powerful heir apparent — but after today he is Fredo forever.”
Whatever Mr. Trump’s flaws and cognitive deficiencies may be, Mr. Frum contends, his “genius” is undeniable in one particular way: He “understands how to mobilize hatred and resentment to his own advantage and profit.” Mr. Frum suggests that instead of focusing on the president’s mental health, we turn our attention to the people and institutions that keep such a president in power — despite knowing better.

“As we marvel or chortle or freak out over these many new revelations, let’s keep our wits about us. There is likely no serious way to respond until November 2018. Let’s focus on that.”
Ms. Walsh picks up where Mr. Frum left off. She writes that her main takeaway from Mr. Wolff’s book and New York Times reporting on Mr. Trump’s interventions in the Russia inquiry is that Republicans “are circling the wagons around Trump.” She does not propose a 25th Amendment solution to the problem, however.

23178,Slate,Surrender or victory?,"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer at the Capitol on Monday. Drew Angerer/Getty Images
A decisive majority of Senate Democrats agreed Monday to end the partial government shutdown that had entered its third day. The deal they voted through funds government operations for three weeks but also funds the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which was in danger of running out of money altogether, for six years. The Dems also say that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has agreed to bring DACA legislation to the floor for debate and voting no later than Feb. 8.
Was this a clever way of ending a shutdown they would have been blamed for while securing children’s health coverage and bringing DACA—a subject on which Democrats have public support when it’s polled in isolation—one step closer to a vote? Or was it an absurdly early capitulation in which the party betrayed its moral obligation to Dreamers in return for nothing more than a flimsy agreement with an unreliable partner so not to look as if they were hurting the military? Progressives online, even some with similar ideological priors who generally tend to agree with each other, are truly split.

MADISON, Wis. — The spring and summer will be packed with elections in Wisconsin.
Primaries will be held May 15 for two seats in the Legislature, with special elections to follow June 12. Two months late later, on Aug. 14, primaries will be held to determine which Democrat will face GOP Gov. Scott Walker and which Republican will go up against Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin.
Two Republicans and a Democrat have filed paperwork to replace former state Sen. Frank Lasee, R-De Pere, who stepped down in December to take a job in Walker's administration.
The Republicans seeking the Senate District 1 seat are Rep. André Jacque and businessman Alex Renard, both of De Pere. Caleb Frostman of Sturgeon Bay, the executive director of the Door County Economic Development Corp., is the lone Democrat in that race.
The district includes portions of Door, Kewaunee, Manitowoc, Brown and Calumet counties.
In the race to replace former state Rep. Keith Ripp, R-Lodi — who also took a job in December with Walker — three Republicans and one Democrat so far have filed signatures to get on the ballot.
The Republicans are: karate school owner and Lodi Town Board member Jon Plumer; Colleen Locke-Murphy of Poynette; and self-described ""Trump conservative"" Spencer Zimmerman of Janesville, which is outside Assembly District 42 that includes most of Columbia County and covers parts of Dane, Dodge, Fond du Lac, Green Lake and Marquette counties.
Lodi alderwoman Ann Groves Lloyd is the only Democrat in the race so far. Gene Rubenstein of Pardeeville is running as an independent.
Others could still get in both races. Paperwork is due by 5 p.m. Tuesday.
Walker called the special elections in March after losing a lawsuit brought by a group run by Eric Holder, the attorney general under former president Barack Obama. A Dane County judge found state law required Walker to promptly schedule those special elections; Walker and other Republicans said holding the special elections was a waste of money because regular elections would be held this fall.
Whoever wins the seats in June will have to stand for election again in November.

7861,The Guardian,West Papuan activist on trial for treason over independence petition,"Campaigners have called for the release of Yanto Awerkion, 27, who faces six years to life in jail if found guilty in Indonesian court
West Papuan independence campaigners have called for the release of an activist who has been put on trial for treason after he helped gather signatures for a petition.
Yanto Awerkion was arrested for his involvement in a pro-independence petition which gathered more than 1.8m West Papuan signatures.
The petition, calling for a free vote on independence, had been outlawed by Indonesian authorities but was smuggled out of the region and delivered to the United Nations in September.
The 27-year-old man is deputy chair of the Timika branch of the pro-independence West Papua National Committee (KNPB). According to his supporters he was arrested after getting on stage to speak about the petition at an event in May.

The Free West Papua campaign said Awerkion’s health had seriously deteriorated in jail, and he had not been able to see his wife and daughter.
If convicted on the charges relating to sedition and separatism, conspiracy and incitement to commit an offence, Awerkion could face a prison term of between six years and life.
His trial was scheduled to begin in Timika on Tuesday.
In a video filmed from prison for the Free West Papua movement, Awerkion described himself as a political prisoner.
“Because of struggling for Free West Papua, I was arrested by the Indonesian military and police, and I remain in prison,” he said.
He called for international diplomats to “unite and urge the world and the United Nations to intervene in West Papua and to immediately organise a referendum in West Papua”.
A spokesman for the Indonesian embassy in Australia, Sade Bimantara, said the rights of people to “peacefully voice their opinions” were protected under Indonesian law, but “when laws are broken, the authorities will act to enforce the law”.
This included activities supporting or inciting acts that aim to “take over or separate a part of the Indonesian territory and the formation of a new state in its place”, he told Guardian Australia.

Bimantara did not detail Awerkion’s alleged actions, but said “separatist groups in Papua and West Papua have been found to commit a number of offences”, and noted the death of a policeman last year.
Awerkion is not believed to be facing charges involving violence. Bimantara said that was a matter for the prosecutor.
The petition asked the UN to “put West Papua back on the decolonisation committee agenda and ensure their right to self‐determination … is respected by holding an internationally supervised vote”.
West Papua was annexed by Indonesia in 1963, an act formalised six years later with a widely discredited UN-supervised vote known as the Act of Free Choice. The only voters were 1,063 people selected by the military and compelled to vote in favour of Indonesian annexation.
“In the West Papuan people’s petition we hand over the bones of the people of West Papua to the United Nations and the world,” exiled independence leader Benny Wenda told the UN when the petition was handed over.
“After decades of suffering, decades of genocide, decades of occupation, we open up the voice of the West Papuan people which lives inside this petition. My people want to be free.”
Indonesian foreign ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir said at the time the petition was “purely a publicity stunt with no credibility”.
The petition also called for the appointment of a special representative to investigate human rights abuses but was ultimately rebuffed by the UN’s decolonisation committee because West Papua was outside its mandate.
There are frequent reports of mass arrests and violence by Indonesian police and military forces against separatists and their supporters, but information is difficult to verify because of restrictions on foreign media entering the territory.
The leader of the Greens, Richard Di Natale, called for the Australian government to make entreaties on behalf of Awerkion and other prisoners, and to support West Papua’s calls for a UN-backed referendum.",LEFT
180987,ABC News,US 'deeply dismayed' over Maldives prison sentences,"The United States said it is dismayed by the prison sentences given to an ex-Maldivian president and two Supreme Court judges and urged the increasingly authoritarian government to uphold the rule of law.
A Maldives court sentenced ex-President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom to one year, seven months and six days in prison on Wednesday for failing to hand over his mobile phone to investigators after he was accused of plotting to overthrow the government of his half brother, who has declared a state of emergency and cracked down on his critics. Two Supreme Court judges, Abdulla Saeed and Ali Hameed, who were arrested with Gayoom, were given the same sentences for the same offense.
Saeed and Hameed previously had been given jail sentences for allegedly influencing lower court decisions.
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement that the U.S. is ""deeply dismayed"" by reports that they were sentenced without a fair trial. She said it casts ""serious doubt"" on the government's commitment to the rule of law.
Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ruled the Indian Ocean archipelago state from 1978 to 2008, is the second former president to be jailed under President Yameen Abdul Gayoom's rule. He was arrested in February on charges of attempting to overthrow his half brother.
Maldives, known for its high-end tourist resorts, became a multiparty democracy in 2008, ending Gayoom's 30-year strongman rule. However, Yameen, who was elected in 2013, has rolled back much of the democratic gains.
Mohamed Nasheed, the country's first freely elected president in 2008, was earlier given a 13-year sentence in a trial widely criticized for due process violations. He was granted asylum in Britain when he went there on leave from prison for medical treatment.
Yameen's former vice president, Ahmed Adeeb, two former defense ministers, a prosecutor general and opposition lawmakers are among those who have been jailed during Yameen's tenure. All of the trials have been criticized for alleged lack of fairness.
With all of his potential opponents either in jail or in exile, Yameen is preparing to run for re-election in September virtually unopposed.
In the statement released Thursday, Nauert said the sentences also call into question the willingness of the Maldives government ""to permit a free and fair presidential election in September that reflects the will of the Maldivian people.""
Nauert called on Maldives to release all political prisoners and ensure that parties and candidates are able to campaign freely.
A five-member Supreme Court bench in February ordered the release and retrial of Nasheed and other prisoners, calling their sentences politically motivated. However, Yameen declared a state of emergency and had Saeed, Hameed, and Gayoom arrested.
The three remaining Supreme Court judges later overturned their previous decision to release political prisoners.",CENTER
196626,Reuters,Italy's new PM swings from tough to soft at EU summit debut,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Italy’s new prime minister opened his first European Union summit in bold style but ended it more meekly, yielding to a vague joint statement in which EU leaders offered little commitment to his demands on migration.

Giuseppe Conte came to Brussels aiming to persuade other states to take in a share of the thousands of economic migrants landing in Italy from boats in the Mediterranean - after years in which many had failed to accept even the smaller numbers of asylum seekers escaping wars or persecution.
But he went home with a convoluted agreement on sharing refugees only with willing countries, which could allow the most reluctant eastern European states and others to opt out with no consequences.
The mild-mannered law professor, catapulted into Italy’s top job this month despite having no political experience, took a hardline stance on his arrival at the EU summit on Thursday.
In line with the euroskeptic tones often used by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League party which back his executive, Conte first threatened to veto the summit’s conclusions.
Then he temporarily blocked the joint text, which set EU common positions on a range of issues from global trade to security.
His move was unconventional, especially for a leader on his debut, and meant to obtain more help from EU partners on migration. It yielded little result but the cancellation of a planned news conference of EU leaders on Thursday.
The final joint text, adopted on Friday, hinges on “voluntary” actions on migration from EU states.
Conte at first claimed it represented a victory, but softened his tone after League leader Matteo Salvini showed caution.
At a news conference on Friday after the two-day EU summit, he toughened it again, telling reporters he had “bullied” his peers into the migration deal. He appeared to have very different views from his German and French partners on what it meant.
Images from the long night of talks showed Conte working closely with France’s President Emmanuel Macron, with whom he reached a preliminary compromise on new centers to handle migrants’ asylum requests in willing EU countries.
But in his public statements, Conte tried to distance himself from the French president, who is in constant conflict with Italy’s Home Affairs Minister Salvini.
The Italian prime minister disputed Macron’s statements that France would be exempt from hosting migrant centers. “Macron was tired. I deny what he said,” Conte told reporters.",CENTER

A trust which runs seven academies in Cheshire and Staffordshire is to close because it ""cannot continue to operate financially"", its chairman has said.
University of Chester Academies Trust (UCAT) had faced criticism over its finances and teaching standards.
Chairman David Wootton said its schools would be ""re-brokered"" to new owners and the trust would work to ""make the transition as smooth as possible"".
The Department for Education (DfE) said it would ""support"" the move.
Mr Wootton said that ""given the situation, the board has reached a view that the trust cannot continue"".
A UCAT spokesman added it would work with the Department for Education ""to ensure that a new trust is found as quickly as possible for each of the seven schools"".
Pupils 'most important'
Managers announced the trust intended to offload four schools in Northwich and Kidsgrove to new operators in May, after the government served the organisation with a ""financial notice to improve"" due to a £3m deficit.
UCAT had intended to continue running three schools - the University Church of England Academy in Ellesmere Port, University Academy Warrington and the University Church Free School in Chester.
However, Education Minister Nick Gibb said the Ellesmere Port academy would be removed from the trust, after it was decided ""the leadership of the trust was not taking sufficient action"" to address a recent ""inadequate"" Ofsted rating.
The trust announced that as a result, it would ""formally wind up its activities"", because it ""cannot continue to operate financially and provide the education we would wish with only two schools"".
The Department for Education said it would continue to ""support and challenge"" the trust until all of its schools are under the control of new trusts.
Weaver Vale MP Mike Amesbury, whose constituency includes one of the schools in Northwich, said the ""most important people in all of this are the pupils"".
""It's crucial now that this situation is resolved in a way that minimises any disruption to their education,"" he added.",UNDEFINED
100952,CNN,Trump threatens to slap $100 billion in additional tariffs on China,"President Donald Trump ratcheted up the trade war rhetoric with China on Thursday, saying he was considering another $100 billion in tariffs on the country.
""In light of China's unfair retaliation, I have instructed the [United States Trade Representative] to consider whether $100 billion of additional tariffs would be appropriate,"" the president said in a statement.
Earlier this week, the United States announced new tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, claiming that China is stealing US intellectual property. China responded within hours by announcing $50 billion worth of tariffs on US goods.
The moves follow US tariffs that were imposed earlier this year on Chinese steel and aluminum, which also prompted a response from China.
The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately issue a response to Trump's proposed new round of tariffs.
Related: China takes aim at America's soybean farmers
Dow futures fell after Trump's announcement on Thursday and were down about 400 points in after-hours trading.
That followed a day of stock market gains as investors appeared to warm to the idea that the barbs between Washington and Beijing were all talk.
Investors were reassured by Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House National Economic Council, who also characterized the tariffs as just proposals in remarks on Thursday.
How China gets what it wants from American companies
He told reporters there is ""nothing around the corner"" regarding any concrete tariff plans.
The US threatened to levy import taxes on more than 1,300 Chinese products, including TVs, dishwashers and printers. In turn, China vowed to target key US exports, including soybeans.
Trade war? Not so fast. Why stocks are rallying again
""Rather than remedy its misconduct, China has chosen to harm our farmers and manufacturers,"" Trump's statement reads.
Trump said he instructed to the USTR to ""identify the products upon which to impose"" the additional tariffs he suggested.
US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in a statement late Thursday called Trump's request ""appropriate.""
""China has chosen to respond thus far with threats to impose unjustified tariffs on billions of dollars in U.S. exports, including our agricultural products,"" Lighthizer said. ""Such measures would undoubtedly cause further harm to American workers, farmers, and businesses. Under these circumstances, the President is right to ask for additional appropriate action to obtain the elimination of the unfair acts, policies, and practices identified in USTR's report.""

Trump also implied that China’s President Xi Jinping may be trying to influence the North Koreans to take a harder line with the U.S., perhaps in response to U.S. pressure on trade.
Bolton recently suggested that North Korea should follow the model of Libya, which over a decade ago abandoned its effort to build nuclear weapons.

It was one of history’s miracles: a continent ravaged by dictatorship, genocide and war transformed itself into a model of democracy and broadly shared prosperity.
Indeed, by the early years of this century Europeans were in many ways better off than Americans. Unlike us, they had guaranteed health care, which went along with higher life expectancy; they had much lower rates of poverty; they were actually more likely than we were to be gainfully employed during their prime working years.
But now Europe is in big trouble. So, of course, are we. In particular, while democracy is under siege on both sides of the Atlantic, the collapse of freedom, if it comes, will probably happen here first. But it’s worth taking a break from our own Trumpian nightmare to look at Europe’s woes, some but not all of which parallel ours.
Many of Europe’s problems come from the disastrous decision, a generation ago, to adopt a single currency. The creation of the euro led to a temporary wave of euphoria, with vast amounts of money flowing into nations like Spain and Greece; then the bubble burst. And while countries like Iceland that retained their own money were able to quickly regain competitiveness by devaluing their currencies, eurozone nations were forced into a protracted depression, with extremely high unemployment, as they struggled to get their costs down.",LEFT

""Despite a number of steps this administration has taken...we continue to see unacceptable levels of illegal drugs, dangerous gang activity transnational criminal organizations and illegal immigration flow across our border,"" she said.
""The president has directed that the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security work together with our governors to deploy our National Guard to our southwest border to assist the border patrol,"" she said. ""The president will be signing a proclamation to that effect today.""
Details about what the National Guard would do and how many would be deployed and for how long were not immediately disclosed.
Under the George W. Bush administration, deploying the National Guard to the border cost $415 million dollars.
Nielsen pointed to what she described as increasing fraud and exploited loopholes among arrivals on the southern border, saying traffickers have been advertising that if migrants have children with them, then they are more likely to be released into the U.S. She also said that almost 50 percent of arriving aliens are from Central America.
""Traffickers and smugglers know that these individuals cannot under U.S. law be easily removed in an expeditious way back to their country of origin and so they exploit the loophole,"" she said, adding that the ability to game the system acts as a magnet for more migrants.
She said that the administration has drafted legislation and will ask Congress to provide legal authority and resources to address the problem.
""We will not allow illegal immigration levels to become the norm,"" she said. ""More than 1,000 people a day, 300,000 a year violating our sovereignty as a nation will never be acceptable to this president.""
Trump had tweeted earlier Wednesday that he would “be taking strong action today” on the Mexico border, a day after he said that he wants to send the military to secure it until a wall is built.
Arguing that the U.S. border laws “are very weak” compared to Mexico and Canada, he accused Democrats of wanting immigrants “to pour into our country unchecked.”
Former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush had deployed the National Guard to the border in response to security issues.
The Associated Press reported that the White House was considering a model similar to a Bush-era operation, where in 2006 6,000 National Guard troops were sent to assist the border patrol with non-law enforcement duties while additional border agents were hired and trained.
Trump's recent focus on illegal immigration appeared to have been partly motivated by a caravan of more than 1,000 Central American migrants heading toward the U.S. border.
Trump had threatened to end the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and to cut foreign aid to countries such as Honduras, from where many of the migrants originate, if the caravan was not stopped.
Trump said Tuesday that he believes the caravan is being broken up after he had a conversation with Mexican officials.
Nielsen said on Tuesday that she had been advised by Mexican officials that “the caravan is dissipating” and that several hundred migrants had been repatriated.
“We will not accept the lawlessness of these types of efforts and those who choose to violate our laws, and those who conspire to assist others to violate our laws, will face criminal prosecution,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said. “The Department of Justice fully supports the efforts of the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security announced today to secure our border. I will soon be announcing additional Department of Justice initiatives to restore legality to the southern border.”

97331,CBS News,"Former Gov. Chris Christie on Pruitt controversy: ""I don't know how you survive this one""","Former governor and Trump ally Chris Christie is questioning how long EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has left in the Trump administration after weekend reports exposed possible ethics violations. Christie's comments come after it was revealed Pruitt rented a condo in D.C. from an energy lobbyist for just $50 a day.
Speaking on ABC's ""This Week"", Christie, who suffered a series of his own personal ethics blunders while serving as New Jersey's governor, claimed that Pruitt's issues stem from being the wrong man for the job.
""The president's been ill-served by this, and if Mr. Pruitt's going to go, it's because he should have never been there in the first place,"" said Christie. He added that the Trump transition was ""brutally unprofessional"" from the very beginning.
""This was a transition that didn't vet people for this type of judgment issues, which I think could have been seen very easily in a lot of these people,"" he added.
When asked if Pruitt needs to resign, Christie replied, ""I don't know how you survive this one.""
Pruitt rented a bedroom in a Capitol Hill condo from the wife of a Washington lobbyist for $50 a day from mid-February through the end of July in 2017, CBS News confirmed. Pruitt's daughter also lived in the condo while she was interning at the White House. Pruitt's landlord was Vicki Hart, the wife of Steven Hart, a Washington lobbyist whose firm represents a number of fossil fuel companies.
The deal required Pruitt only to pay the nightly rate when he stayed there, and he was not charged for nights when he slept elsewhere. Pruitt traveled regularly, often returning to Oklahoma on the weekends.
Pruitt has also been scrutinized for his travel. A work trip to Italy last year cost taxpayers $120,000. Pruitt told CBS News in February that his next flight would likely be coach.

113695,Breitbart,Amy Schumer Brought to Tears Lamenting the Trump ‘Nightmare’,"Actress-comedian Amy Schumer groused in a recent interview with Time that the election of Donald Trump has been a “nightmare,” for her comedy career if nothing else.
“I’ve been doing less standup, just because it’s not funny,” Schumer says of the country’s current political climate, as “tears come to her eyes,” according to Time.
The 36-year-old, who supported Hillary Clinton’s 2016 White House bid, has long-despised politics while gradually increasing her participation in it.
A year and a half after revealing that her vow to “move to Spain or somewhere” if Trump were elected was a joke, Schumer has become an outspoken advocate for gun control, DACA illegals, and the anti-sexual harassment campaign Time’s Up.
To be sure, Schumer admits that she’s aware of how her politics attracts detractors — last May, her Netflix special, The Leather Special, debuted to hundreds of one-star reviews from Netflix members. Schumer blamed right-wing Internet trolls for flooding the zone with negative reviews.
“There will be a movement on Reddit to try and get the movie voted down, to actually hurt me,” she says of her latest comedy, I Feel Pretty, which faced backlash from women who accused the film of body shaming weeks before its April 20 theatrical release. “But I’m not going to let that slow me down.”
Its PG-13 rating notwithstanding, I Feel Pretty is reportedly on track to open behind Schumer’s last two big-screen comedies, Trainwreck and Snatched (which both carried an R-rating). Schumer confesses the film has its flaws.
“It’s not a perfect movie,” she admits about the film which follows a fat woman (Schumer) who falls off an exercise bike, hits her head, and wakes up feeling like she has supermodel looks. “It would be great if my role had been played by a woman of color and there were more trans people in it, more people with disabilities. But it’s a step in the right direction, I hope.”
I Feel Pretty, which stars Schumer, Michelle Williams, Emily Ratajkowski, Rory Scovel, and Busy Philipps, opens everywhere on April 20.

61478,The New York Times,"No Matter the Verdict, Corruption Trial Taints Cuomo","Photo
No matter the outcome of the federal trial of Joseph Percoco, Gov. Andrew Cuomo may need a raw steak to go with the ziti that was an ingredient in the courtroom drama. The steak would be for the black eye he has suffered in this corruption case, now in the jury’s hands.
Nothing in this tawdry affair works to his benefit. If Mr. Percoco, the governor’s former aide and family friend, is convicted of charges that he took gobs of bribe money — ziti, in his “Sopranos”-inflected argot — it will reflect poorly on Mr. Cuomo. But even if the verdict is not guilty, the ethical pall over Albany and its chief executive will not be dispelled. Bribery described as pasta has a way of sticking in people’s heads. “This is not how honest and honorable public servants talk,” a federal prosecutor, David Zhou, correctly noted to the jurors on Tuesday.
Even without government allegations of wrongdoing by Mr. Cuomo, he doesn’t quite hit all the right ethical notes. In this regard, he is not alone.
His political nemesis, Mayor Bill de Blasio, is destined to be haunted by one Harendra Singh, a restaurant owner who, it was recently reported, secretly pleaded guilty to bribing Mr. de Blasio in return for help getting favorable lease terms. No charges were brought against the mayor or his aides. Federal prosecutors noted last year that making a case would have been difficult, presumably because the United States Supreme Court had raised the bar for proving political corruption months before Mr. Singh’s plea in 2016.

Nonetheless, the specter of shadowy behavior isn’t going away, not with Mr. Singh figuring in another federal corruption trial about to begin, that of Edward Mangano, a former Nassau County executive. He’s accused of taking Singh bribes. Mr. Mangano’s lawyers have left little doubt that they will make Mr. Singh’s de Blasio connection — and the absence of any charges against the mayor — part of a strategy to discredit him as a prosecution witness.

20312,HuffPost,"One Year In, Trump’s Style Is A Stress Test On Global Alliances","In the year since he took office, President Donald Trump has challenged rock-solid assumptions about U.S. foreign policy and jeopardized relations with a series of key allies.
From insults directed at foreign leaders ― and entire countries ― to his administration’s foreign intelligence gaffes, Trump has left U.S. allies nervous as America’s global competitors gain serious ground.
Mexico And ‘The Wall’
From the day he announced his campaign, Trump adopted an antagonistic approach to Mexico. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said, adding, “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”
Since then, the U.S. president has threatened to blow up or renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has insisted Mexico will pay for a border wall between the two countries.
The battle over the wall has come to dominate the U.S.-Mexico relationship, despite decades of closer trade and security ties. Trump’s fierce criticism of the U.S. neighbor has left Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto exposed at home, and former Mexican President Vicente Fox Quesada fuming:
Hello, @realDonaldTrump, it's me with a small reminder for you: We're still NOT paying for your #FuckingWall. https://t.co/RDlaifwPr1 — Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) June 7, 2017
.@realDonaldTrump, your mouth is the foulest shithole in the world. With what authority do you proclaim who’s welcome in America and who’s not. America’s greatness is built on diversity, or have you forgotten your immigrant background, Donald? — Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) January 11, 2018
A Bad Start With Australia
Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull have a seemingly friendly relationship in public, but it wasn’t always that way.
Turnbull and Trump’s infamous first phone call made for a shaky start. The president accused the Five Eyes ally of trying to send the “next Boston bombers” via a refugee swap deal, prompting Turnbull to confront him over the deal’s importance. Scheduled for an hour, the phone call reportedly lasted just 25 minutes. Trump eventually agreed to the deal.
Since then, the pair appear to have warmed to each other, sharing dinner and drinks on the USS Intrepid in New York City. Turnbull recently praised Trump’s rhetoric on North Korea, telling an Australian radio station it was ratcheting up pressure on the rogue nation.
“They cannot be rewarded for their rogue status and reckless conduct,” Turnbull said.
‘The Wrong Thing To Do’ In Britain
The “special relationship” between the U.S. and the United Kingdom entered a new phase with Trump’s election: awkwardness. British Prime Minister Theresa May was the first foreign leader to visit Trump, a signal of the security and trade partnerships the two countries have shared since World War II.
But May quickly faced pressure to change her tone, particularly after intelligence surrounding the Manchester terror attack was seemingly leaked in the U.S.
The awkwardness came to a head in early January this year, when Trump retweeted several videos from the far-right Britain First party. May called the retweets “wrong,” while several other British MPs described Trump as “fascist” and “stupid.”

An Altered Relationship With Germany
Under Trump, U.S. relations with Germany have been strained and unsettled by Trump’s controversial policy decisions, like pulling out of the Paris climate accord, and his direct criticism of German policies and its leaders.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said earlier this year that Berlin may not be able to rely on the U.S. in the future, and she urged Europe to take its fate into its own hands.
“Germany can no longer simply react to U.S. policy but must establish its own position,” Germany’s top diplomat, Sigmar Gabriel, warned policymakers at the end of last year.
“Even after Trump leaves the White House, relations with the U.S. will never be the same,” he added.
Trump has yet to appoint an ambassador to Germany.

Worrying NATO Allies
Trump used the 68-year-old North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a punching bag in the lead-up to the election, blasting the alliance as “obsolete” and calling out members like Germany for not paying their fair share.
He continued the practice throughout the first year of his presidency. During a speech in Brussels last May, the president refused to affirm his commitment to Article 5 of the treaty — which holds that an attack against one alliance member is considered an attack against all members. (Trump later did affirm his commitment to the article.)
But the future for the alliance isn’t entirely bleak. The number of U.S. personnel being deployed in Europe has gone up, Slovakia’s former ambassador to NATO, Tomas Valasek, told NPR. The real question is how Trump will respond when an ally is attacked.
“The honest answer is none of us quite knows,” Valasek said.
Insulting Haiti And African Countries
Trump opened 2018 by offending some of America’s key allies in Africa. After he reportedly referred to nations in Africa, as well as Haiti, as “shithole countries,” the presidents of Ghana and Senegal made their displeasure known.
“We will not accept such insults, even from a leader of a friendly country, no matter how powerful,” said Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo. Ghana has close ties to the United States.
Senegalese President Macky Sall also expressed his shock over the remarks.“I reject them and condemn vigorously. Africa and the black race deserve the respect and consideration of all,” Sall said.

192250,Politico,Supreme Court upholds Trump’s travel ban,"The court divided 5-4 along its usual ideological lines, with conservative justices in the majority insisting they were not endorsing President Donald Trump’s campaign-trail rhetoric calling for a ban on Muslim immigration to the U.S. Supreme Court upholds Trump’s travel ban The new high court decision marks the conclusion of a protracted legal fight over the travel ban, which critics argue stems from Trump’s discriminatory attitude toward Muslims.
The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled in favor of President Donald Trump’s travel ban, a major victory in the administration’s quest to restrict the flow of immigrants and visitors into the United States.
In a 5-4 decision, the justices affirmed the president’s vast powers over matters of national security — even as they grappled with Trump’s anti-Muslim statements and the intent behind the controversial policy.
Story Continued Below
The latest version of the ban levels a range of travel restrictions against five majority-Muslim countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen — as well as North Korea and Venezuela. Chad, another majority Muslim nation, was removed from the list in April.
Although several federal courts had blocked the ban nationwide, the justices allowed the policy to take full effect in December pending consideration of the merits of the case. The temporary order allowing full implementation was an ominous sign for opponents of the Trump policy, particularly since only two justices—liberals Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor— dissented.
The ruling on Tuesday reverses the lower court decisions and will allow the policy to remain in place indefinitely.
“The Proclamation is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority. “The text says nothing about religion.“
Cecillia Wang, deputy legal director with the American Civil Liberties Union, said the decision marked “a dreadful day” for the United States. “But we Americans will fight on to express the will of the people to uphold equality and freedom,” she tweeted.
Prior to the ruling, court-watchers speculated that Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court’s frequent swing vote, might struggle to reconcile the objections to anti-religious bias that he stated in his Masterpiece Cakeshop decision earlier this month with a vote for the Trump administration in the travel ban case.
In Masterpiece Cakeshop, Kennedy upheld a baker's religious-based refusal to sell a cake for a gay wedding on the grounds that a state civil rights commission that ruled against the baker showed “hostility” to the baker’s religious beliefs. In the travel ban case, however, Kennedy apparently set aside concerns about anti-religious bias in deference to the executive branch's prerogatives concerning national security.
The new high court decision marks the conclusion of a protracted legal fight over the travel ban, which critics argue stems from Trump’s discriminatory attitude toward Muslims.

On the campaign trail in December 2015, Trump called for a “total and complete shutdown” of Muslim visitors to the U.S., a reaction to a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. — a promise legal opponents cited as the impetus for the three successive versions of the travel ban.
In a statement posted to his campaign website days after the terror attack, Trump said Muslims needed to be barred until U.S. officials “can figure out what is going on.”
Throughout the litigation over the travel ban, Trump's tweets about the policy have loomed large. As administration lawyers sought to portray the policy as well within presidential authority and unrelated to Trump's campaign vows, Trump often undermined those arguments.
Last June, he expressed regret about altering the original policy, complaining that his lawyers were pushing a ""watered down, politically correct version.""
In September, Trump again suggested that he was unsatisfied with his own policy. ""The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!"" he wrote.
Judges reviewing Trump's policy also seized on his retweeting of anti-Muslim videos from Britain and another message broadcasting an apocryphal story about a U.S. general ordering Muslim radicals shot with bullets dipped in pigs' blood.
Trump wasted little time in office before he signed the first travel ban, which halted visas to people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for a 90-day period and suspended the refugee resettlement program for 120 days. The stated purpose of the policy was to conduct a review of security and vetting from those nations.
During the televised signing of the executive order on a Friday in late January 2017, Trump read a variation on its title, “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,” and added, “We all know what that means.”
Within hours, the policy prompted confusion and distress in airports worldwide — an immediate demonstration of Trump’s disruptive approach to governance and opposition to immigration.
Top administration officials didn’t receive a copy of the order until two hours after the televised signing, according to an inspector general’s report released roughly a year later.
The hasty rollout left U.S. Customs and Border Protection — the agency tasked with implementing the policy — scrambling to figure out which travelers should be barred entry to the U.S. and how to handle green card holders.
Powerful lobbying forces — including major universities, technology companies and tourism-related businesses — mobilized against the ban, and opponents won a series of legal rulings halting the policy. Trump vowed to take the issue directly to the Supreme Court, but the administration eventually opted to rescind the original policy and issue a replacement in March of that year.
The second version of the travel ban dropped Iraq from the list, which spared further embarrassment for a government working closely with American troops to fight ISIS.
In addition, the reworked policy stated that people with green cards and existing visas would not be subject to the 90-day travel pause. The revised order also removed a provision that may have benefited Christian refugees in majority-Muslim nations.
Still, federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland blocked the policy before it could take effect, ruling that the ban amounted to unconstitutional discrimination against Muslims.
The Trump administration failed to convince federal appeals courts to reverse the decision, eventually elevating the matter to the Supreme Court. In June 2017, the justices issued a short-term compromise ruling that permitted Trump to implement his policy, but exempted would-be immigrants and travelers with ""bona fide"" U.S. ties.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration proceeded with a security review of the six nations and refugee program.
When the review of the countries concluded in September, the ban morphed into its third and current iteration, a mix of travel restrictions against citizens of eight countries. In an apparent bid to undermine claims that the policy was aimed at Muslims, Trump added to the mix limits on travelers from Venezuela and North Korea. The latest version of the ban includes provisions for people from all affected nations to apply for waivers to enter the U.S., but immigration attorneys have claimed their clients aren’t being approved.
Even as the legal fight over three separate travel bans played out in court, the Trump administration appeared to achieve its goal of reducing the flow of travelers from those countries.
The number of non-immigrant visas issued to people from six majority-Muslim travel ban countries fell sharply over a one-year period that began in March 2017.
A POLITICO analysis found that over the same period, non-immigrant visas to the world’s 50 Muslim-majority countries dropped 19 percent when compared to levels in fiscal year 2016.

133767,NPR,Trump Administration Ends Temporary Protected Status For Hondurans,"Trump Administration Ends Temporary Protected Status For Hondurans
Enlarge this image toggle caption Fernando Antonio/AP Fernando Antonio/AP
The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Kirstjen M. Nielsen, announced Friday the termination of the program that has protected about 57,000 Hondurans from deportation since 1999.
That designation, known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, came in response to the deadly Hurricane Mitch in 1998, which killed an estimated 10,000 people in Honduras and launched a regional humanitarian crisis.
TPS was created by Congress 1990 to help people from societies wracked by civil conflict or natural disasters.
In a DHS statement, Nielsen said that she is delaying the effective date for termination of TPS for Hondurans for 18 months, until January 5, 2020.
""...the Secretary determined that the disruption of living conditions in Honduras from Hurricane Mitch that served as the basis for its TPS designation has decreased to a degree that it should no longer be regarded as substantial. Thus, as required under the applicable statute, the current TPS designation must be terminated.""
The announcement follows similar decisions by Nielsen to end TPS for almost 200,000 Salvadorans, 50,000 Haitians and 9,000 Nepalis. Smaller numbers of Nicaraguans and Sudanese have also lost TPS under the Trump administration. All of these immigrant groups were given more than a year to leave.
In light of those announcements, immigration advocates were prepared for Nielsen's decision about Hondurans, which they criticized as politically driven and without regard for the actual dangerous conditions in Honduras.
According to a statement by the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc., or CLINIC, the Central American country is in the middle of a humanitarian crisis with a ""staggering"" homicide rate, lack of safe drinking for hundreds of thousands of people and chronic childhood hunger.
""The administration has attempted to paint a picture that it has no choice but to terminate TPS,"" said CLINIC executive director Jeanne Atkinson.
""Its action seems to suggest that all of the past Republican and Democratic administrations that extended TPS for Honduras have not properly applied the law. To the contrary, it is the Trump administration's action that disregards the law and the intent of Congress in creating TPS in the first place to safeguard human lives,"" said Atkinson.
But supporters of the Trump administration praised the announcement.
""The hurricane that justified it in the first place was two decades ago,"" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the D.C.-based Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates immigration limits. ""At some point, temporary needs to mean temporary.""
However, Krikorian said, he would have preferred that the Trump administration gave Hondurans only six months to arrange to leave and not eighteen months.
""It [TPS] has to stop somewhere and somebody is going to be inconvenienced by this,"" he added.
But Miami business owner Orlando Lopez calls the decision a ""disaster"" for him and his family. He's 55, has a small trucking company with ten employees and he supports his family back in Honduras.
In an interview with NPR, Lopez said Americans don't understand how difficult life is in Honduras.
""I'm afraid to return. It's a matter of life or death, "" said Lopez.
""Here, I have a business. I pay taxes. I have a clean record. I will have to leave it in God's hands,"" he added.
The government of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said that the decision to end TPS was a sovereign issue for Washington, adding that ""we deeply lament it.""
According to the Associated Press, an ex-Honduran ambassador to the U.S. and former Central Bank president Hugo Noe said the decision will create uncertainty for many families and he predicted that most Hondurans who were covered by TPS will choose to remain in the U.S. illegally rather than return home.",LEFT
184107,Fox News,Pentagon confirms halt of August war games with South Korea,"The Pentagon confirmed Monday that major U.S. military exercises this summer in South Korea would be suspended, following President Trump’s decision.
Dana White, the Pentagon’s chief spokeswoman, said in a late afternoon statement: “Consistent with President Trump’s commitment and in concert with our Republic of Korea ally, the United States military has suspended all planning for this August’s defensive ‘wargame’ (Freedom Guardian).”
The U.S. and South Korea regularly have held major joint exercises with South Korea.
The summer exercise, Ulchi Freedom Guardian, consisted mainly of computer simulations to hone joint decision-making and planning. Some 17,500 American and 50,000 South Korean troops participated last year. The drill, held since the 1970s, usually took place in August.
White added: “We are still coordinating additional actions. No decisions on subsequent wargames have been made.”
Appearing to catch both South Korea and the Pentagon by surprise, last week Trump promised to end war games with South Korea, after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
“We will be stopping the war games, which will save us a tremendous amount of money, unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should,” Trump told reporters after his meeting last Tuesday with Kim in Singapore. “But we’ll be saving a tremendous amount of money. Plus, I think it’s very provocative.”
The president has suggested strongly that the meeting with Kim ensured that North Korea was no longer a threat.
Kim has labeled the exercises practice for an invasion of North Korea.
“Holding back the ‘war games’ during the negotiations was my request because they are VERY EXPENSIVE and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation,” Trump tweeted Sunday. “Also, quite provocative. Can start up immediately if talks break down, which I hope will not happen!”
Military.com reported that later this week a Pentagon meeting with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John Bolton would discuss future defensive cooperation with South Korea under the countries’ alliance.

93098,CNN,The race to militarize space is no joke,"David Pedreira is a science fiction author whose debut novel, ""Gunpowder Moon,"" envisions a near-future where superpowers go to the brink of war over resource mining on the moon. He is a former newspaper reporter and current business owner. His novel can be found at www.davidpedreira.com. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.
(CNN) One of the first weapons in space was a triple-barreled handgun designed to kill Russian bears. Cosmonauts brought it with them into orbit in case their descent module landed in a Siberian forest.
Those were simpler times -- at least in terms of celestial firepower. The militarization of space is in full gear today, and it isn't focused on 800-pound omnivores. People may have understandably snickered at President Donald Trump's call for a US ""space force,"" but the laughter masks the fact that too few are noticing the rush by world powers to develop warfighting capabilities in orbit.
Rhetoric often outstrips reality in geopolitics, and a lot of experts say fears of a new arms race in space are overblown, but consider these recent headlines:
• The Pentagon told Congress this month it is studying a combatant command for space warfare to counter recent efforts by China and Russia to militarize Earth orbit.
• US Air Force Chief of Staff General David L. Goldfein warned last month that American forces will find themselves fighting from space ""in a matter of years.""
• China tested a direct ascent anti-satellite and antiballistic missile system in February that analysts say could destroy most US satellites.
• Russian President Vladimir Putin boasted this month of a hypersonic glide vehicle that can be launched into space, navigate on its own into Earth's atmosphere and avoid radar and antimissile defenses.
All three countries, and others including North Korea and India , are testing systems such as lasers that fry or dazzle satellites, space-borne electromagnetic pulse weapons that can knock out power grids, and satellites that maneuver in orbit and target each other.
Of course, this isn't entirely new. Concerns about weaponizing the cosmos have been around for decades, and international laws have been written to stave them off. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which laid much of the foundation for space law, prohibits weapons of mass destruction in orbit, on the moon or on other celestial bodies. But the treaty doesn't directly ban conventional weapons in space, or weapons fired from Earth into space.
Efforts have been made to strengthen space nonproliferation laws, but none of the major powers seem to be honest brokers in the endeavor. While Russia and China blast the United States for refusing to agree to the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space resolution in the United Nations, they're also actively testing anti-satellite systems and making no secret about their research and development for space weaponry.
And the US military has been flying a secretive, unmanned mini-space shuttle called the X-37B since 2010. It stays in orbit for two years at a time. The Air Force insists it isn't a potential weapons platform. The Chinese and Russians are dubious.
So where does this leave us? Science fiction writers like looking at things from 50,000 feet up -- or even 50,000 miles. And the view from that height is chilling.
Calling for an outright ban on weaponry buzzing around low or high-Earth orbit feels like tilting at windmills at this point. There's too much momentum in the wrong direction. And few are talking about the even bigger issue outside of Earth's gravitational embrace: the future resource mining of the moon, the asteroid belt and other parts of the solar system.
It's understandable, because so far there's been nothing worth fighting for in deep space. It costs thousands of dollars to put one pound of payload into orbit. Mining an asteroid for rare metals just isn't cost-effective or technically achievable -- yet.
But the price to launch material into space is dropping, and companies and governments are gearing up for when the tech is ready. Consider that an asteroid with the scientifically dreary name of 2011 UW158 comes within a few million miles of Earth in its eccentric orbit -- and it reportedly contains about $5.4 trillion worth of platinum.
An economic market that makes the Silk Road look like a five-and-dime will eventually open up in the solar system. And when has humanity ever kept peace in the face of such a mother lode? Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk may have good intentions for space today, but what about the astro-tycoons wrestling over trillion-dollar rocks in the future?

Even if we take the most cynical approach about the growing arms race in Earth orbit -- that it's a fait accompli -- can't we at least make a push for an absolute weapons ban in those regions of the solar system that haven't already been compromised? Physicists, astronomers and influencers such as science fiction authors could lend their voices to such an effort. They could argue that we don't have to take the sins of the Earth with us into the heavens.",UNDEFINED
177428,Breitbart,Tesla Lays Off Thousands of Workers Days After Elon Musk Flamethrower Party,"The company, which currently employees 46,000 workers, will show 3,500 people the door amid struggles to meet its production rate of 5,000 Model 3 cars in a single week by June’s end.
“Tesla shares pared an earlier gain of as much as 6.9 percent and were up 4.5 percent to $347.19 as of 1:46 p.m. in New York trading. The stock is up about 11 percent this year,” Bloomberg reports.
The announcement comes just days after Musk held a flamethrower party over the weekend in Hawthorne, California for customers who snapped up his $500 Boring Company flamethrower. The Boring Company sold 20,000 flamethrowers in “sold 20,000 units — or $10 million worth — in just five days,” CNBC reports.
Read Musk’s entire email on the layoff below:
As described previously, we are conducting a comprehensive organizational restructuring across our whole company. Tesla has grown and evolved rapidly over the past several years, which has resulted in some duplication of roles and some job functions that, while they made sense in the past, are difficult to justify today.
As part of this effort, and the need to reduce costs and become profitable, we have made the difficult decision to let go of approximately 9% of our colleagues across the company. These cuts were almost entirely made from our salaried population and no production associates were included, so this will not affect our ability to reach Model 3 production targets in the coming months.
Given that Tesla has never made an annual profit in the almost 15 years since we have existed, profit is obviously not what motivates us. What drives us is our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable, clean energy, but we will never achieve that mission unless we eventually demonstrate that we can be sustainably profitable. That is a valid and fair criticism of Tesla’s history to date.
This week, we are informing those whose roles are impacted by this action. We made these decisions by evaluating the criticality of each position, whether certain jobs could be done more efficiently and productively, and by assessing the specific skills and abilities of each individual in the company. As you know, we are also continuing to flatten our management structure to help us communicate better, eliminate bureaucracy and move faster.
In addition to this company-wide restructuring, we’ve decided not to renew our residential sales agreement with Home Depot in order to focus our efforts on selling solar power in Tesla stores and online. The majority of Tesla employees working at Home Depot will be offered the opportunity to move over to Tesla retail locations.
I would like to thank everyone who is departing Tesla for their hard work over the years. I’m deeply grateful for your many contributions to our mission. It is very difficult to say goodbye. In order to minimize the impact, Tesla is providing significant salary and stock vesting (proportionate to length of service) to those we are letting go.

To be clear, Tesla will still continue to hire outstanding talent in critical roles as we move forward and there is still a significant need for additional production personnel. I also want to emphasize that we are making this hard decision now so that we never have to do this again.
To those who are departing, thank you for everything you’ve done for Tesla and we wish you well in your future opportunities. To those remaining, I would like to thank you in advance for the difficult job that remains ahead. We are a small company in one of the toughest and most competitive industries on Earth, where just staying alive, let alone growing, is a form of victory (Tesla and Ford remain the only American car companies who haven’t gone bankrupt). Yet, despite our tiny size, Tesla has already played a major role in moving the auto industry towards sustainable electric transport and moving the energy industry towards sustainable power generation and storage. We must continue to drive that forward for the good of the world.
Thanks,

54365,The Guardian,New Russian stealth fighter spotted in Syria,"Deployment of two Su-57 fighter aircraft marks the latest high-tech military system that Russia has shown in Syria conflict
Moscow appears to have deployed an advanced new stealth fighter to its airbase in Syria, reports in Russian news media and online videos of the aircraft indicated on Thursday, in what analysts say could be a risky attempt to gain publicity and operational experience for the jet in one of the world’s most tangled conflicts.
Their appearance comes at a fraught moment in the seven-year war, as the US and Russia occasionally scramble jets to intercept each over Syria and pro-regime warplanes pound the Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta despite protests from the UN. More than 330 people have been killed there since the bombing began on Sunday, according to reports.
The deployment of two Su-57 fighter aircraft, which were filmed landing at Russia’s Khmeimim Airbase along the Mediterranean coast, would mark the latest high-tech military system that Russia has exhibited in Syria, a conflict that has already been used to demonstrate the prowess of Russian cruise missiles and combat helicopters.
Both the Kremlin and the Ministry of Defence declined to comment on whether the fifth-generation Russian fighter jets, which are still in combat testing phases, had been deployed. Russian news agencies, including the respected RBC business daily, published reports on Thursday saying that sources in the Ministry of Defence had confirmed the presence of the advanced fighter jets in Syria.
The military had previously announced it would begin to test the fighters in combat. They have been touted as a future rival to the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, which the US uses in patrols over Syria.
“We are buying Su-57 jets for test combat use. First stage state trials are over,” Yuri Borisov, the deputy minister of defence, said earlier in February.
US-led forces wounded and killed dozens of Russian mercenaries and pro-Assad militiamen in early February, in a battle near the city of Deir Ezzor that saw US drones and warplanes directly target Russians fighting on the side of the government for the first time in the war.
Russia has regularly used the conflict as a testing ground for its latest military technology and has even credited it for an uptick in arms sales. The Su-57, the first operational Russian jet to use stealth technology, has been plagued by cost and time overruns, and analysts said there could be a business rationale behind the deployment.
“There is some operational merit in doing this, but there’s also a publicity element,” said Douglas Barrie, a senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, by telephone on Thursday. He noted that a successful demonstration of the plane in Syria could assuage concerns of potential buyers like the Indian government.
It is still unclear whether the aircraft could play any role in day-to-day operations.
“We haven’t seen it fire anything. We haven’t seen it drop anything,” Barrie said.
Ruslan Pukhov, a defence analyst and the director of the Moscow-based Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, said it could be “risky” to deploy the new jets to Syria.
“If I were the minister of defence, I probably wouldn’t do it,” he said. “If you lose one of these planes, it could make for big problems. And what happens if the technology falls into the wrong hands?”",LEFT
73388,NBC News,"Trump's assistant out abruptly at White House, heads to campaign","President Donald Trump's longtime personal aide John McEntee is out at the White House, marking yet another departure in an executive office marked by a revolving door of hirings and firings.
CNN reported that McEntee was fired because he is being investigated by the Department of Homeland Security for serious financial crimes, and that he still had not received security clearance for his work. NBC has not confirmed that report.
He will take a job with Trump's re-election campaign, the campaign said Tuesday morning in a release.
McEntee was by Trump's side during the 2016 campaign and during the president's first year at the White House, but struggled to get the necessary security clearances for this role. As of November, McEntee was working with interim security clearances.
""We’re not going to comment on a personnel issue,"" a senior White House official told NBC News about McEntee's changing jobs.

35493,Fox News,Here's what the controversial House Intel surveillance memo says,"The controversial memo purportedly detailing federal surveillance abuses was declassified and released Friday following approval from President Trump.
Compiled by the House Intelligence Committee leadership, the memo states that surveillance warrants used on an American citizen was largely requested due to controversial dossier produced by Fusion GPS, a firm that was at one point hired by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. The dossier contained colorful but unverifiable information about Trump.
Democrats, the FBI and the Department of Justice objected to the release of the memo. In part, Democratic lawmakers suggested that the memo was selectively edited by Republicans to push an agenda of derailing the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Intelligence officials have stressed the memo is incomplete.
Here is what the newly released memo contained:
The dossier was key to warrant requests
Christopher Steele, who compiled the controversial dossier containing colorful but unverifiable claims about Trump, confirmed to former associate deputy attorney general Bruce Ohr that he “was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.”
FISA warrants are not easy to obtain, but the memo suggests that intelligence officials relied heavily on the dossier as well as a 2016 report from Michael Isikoff to obtain the warrants. Isikoff’s Yahoo News report, according to the memo, was “derived from information leaked by Steele himself.”
The FBI and DOJ officials were able to obtain a FISA warrant to electronically target Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to Trump.
Former deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe told the House Intelligence Committee in December 2017 that a surveillance warrant would not have been sought without the dossier and what it purportedly revealed, the memo stated.
The dossier’s funding was not recorded in surveillance warrant requests
The surveillance warrants and renewals did not mention that the dossier was paid for, at least in part, by the Democratic National Committee and the campaign for Hillary Clinton. The memo says the DOJ was aware at the time of the initial FISA application that “political actors were involved with the Steele dossier.”
“Neither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steele’s efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were known to senior DOJ and FBI officials,” the memo alleged.
Instead, according to the memo, the FISA application said Steele was working for a ""named U.S. person"" – but did not specifically include Fusion GPS, the firm behind the project, or its co-founder, Glenn Simpson. Fusion GPS was hired by law firm Perkins Coie, which represented the DNC and Clinton campaign.

102993,CNN,"Trump's lawyer referred a client to Stormy Daniels' former lawyer, raising new questions about collaboration","(CNN) Michael D. Cohen, President Trump's longtime personal lawyer, steered a client to Stormy Daniels' then-attorney last fall, a year after the two men negotiated a secret $130,000 deal silencing the porn star about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump, Daniels' attorney confirmed to CNN.
Keith M. Davidson said in a statement provided to CNN that Cohen gave his name to entertainment executive and Trump associate Chuck LaBella, who was being written about on Twitter by actor Tom Arnold.
The referral is potentially significant amid allegations of coziness between Davidson and Cohen contained in a lawsuit filed by another Davidson client, Karen McDougal, who also says she had an affair with Trump. The lawsuit claims that Davidson was part of a ""broad effort to silence and intimidate her and others."" Davidson disputes that claim.
Arnold accused LaBella, who worked as a producer on NBC's ""The Apprentice"" and on Trump's Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, of possessing damning information about the President. Arnold's cryptic tweets did not provide details or evidence to back up his claims.
""Chuck LaBella has all the dirt,"" Arnold tweeted in October of last year.
""Chuck LaBella was there and knows all,"" a second tweet alleged.
A third tweet made a veiled reference to a ""Putin call"" and other matters supposedly linking Trump to Russia.
In response to the tweets, Davidson wrote an email to Arnold's attorney, Marty Singer, asking that the actor stop falsely implicating LaBella as a witness to any alleged misdeeds by Trump, according to a source who has read the email.
Davidson told CNN he was not paid for sending the correspondence and did no further work on the matter. He said he did not know whether Cohen provided LaBella with the names of other attorneys as well.
In response to an inquiry from CNN, LaBella wrote:
""Keith Davidson has never been hired as my counsel. I have never met him. I have never paid him. I have never signed any agreement with him.
""A friend called Keith on my behalf, because of his close relationship with Tom Arnold's lawyer (Marty Singer). To stop Tom Arnold from spreading these slanderous accusations and outright lies.""
Asked whether Cohen was the friend who made the referral, LaBella replied:
""After working for over 30 years in Hollywood, Keith has been know(n) as the fixer. Many people over the years have recommended Keith to me.
He has been in my rolodex, that's how I know of him.""
The New York Times and The Smoking Gun have previously reported that Cohen referred LaBella to Davidson, but did not indicate whether any of the parties involved confirmed the link.
Davidson's confirmation of the referral to CNN follows an exclusive interview earlier this week in which he said he'd spoken with President's lawyer on several occasions regarding two women who claim to have had sex with the married billionaire in 2006. Trump has denied the affairs.
Davidson said he called Cohen in the late summer of 2016 to inform him that he'd settled a case involving Playboy model McDougal. McDougal sold the rights to her story to American Media Inc., the parent company of the National Enquirer, for $150,000 and other perks. Davidson said he informed Cohen of the deal as ""a professional courtesy.""
The Enquirer never published the story, effectively silencing McDougal's claims in the run-up to the election. She has since filed a lawsuit accusing Davidson of ""working closely with representatives for Mr. Trump while pretending to advocate on her behalf.""
Davidson said Cohen had also reached out to him after Daniels appeared on ""60 Minutes"" in late March and described her alleged sexual encounter with Trump. In the interview, Daniels said her lawyer had pressured her to sign a statement falsely stating that the encounter never happened.
""I don't believe that the facts ... in the interview were a fair and accurate representation of my representation of her at the time,"" Davidson told CNN.
Davidson said Cohen advised him that he thought Daniels had violated her confidentiality agreement and encouraged Davidson to ""spill his guts"" about the true circumstances surrounding the deal.
Davidson said he consulted an ethics lawyer and still felt bound by attorney-client privilege, even though he was no longer working with Daniels. He denied working in concert with Cohen on either matter, but declined to discuss details of either case, citing attorney-client privilege.
He told CNN that he and Cohen first intersected in 2011 when Davidson called to inform him that he was representing Daniels in a bid to have a story about her having sex with Trump removed from a gossip website called TheDirty.com. He said the matter was quickly resolved and the story was removed.
Cohen has declined comment on Davidson's characterization of their alleged conversations.
Michael Avenatti, Stormy Daniels' current attorney, said: ""As more evidence comes to light relating to his close personal relationship with Michael Cohen and his efforts to protect Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump at the expense of his clients, we grow increasingly disturbed. ... Mr. Davidson has no business doing Mr. Cohen's bidding for him.""",UNDEFINED
120697,Politico,Police: Waffle House suspect arrested,"A police vehicle sits outside a Waffle House restaurant in Nashville, Tenn., Sunday, April 22, 2018. A man wearing nothing but a coat stormed the restaurant before dawn Sunday and shot several people to death, according to police, who credited a customer with saving lives by wresting a weapon away from the gunman. | Sheila Burke/AP Photo Police: Waffle House suspect arrested
The suspect in a quadruple homicide at a Nashville Waffle House was taken into custody Monday, police said.
Authorities had mounted a massive manhunt for 29-year-old Travis Reinking, after the Sunday morning attacks.
Story Continued Below
Authorities announced the arrest Monday afternoon on Twitter, but did not immediately give details.
More than 100 Nashville police officers had been going door-to-door and searching wooded areas, joined by dozens of agents with the FBI, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and troopers with the Tennessee Highway Patrol.
Police said he had stolen a BMW days before the attack. The car was quickly recovered, but authorities did not immediately link it to Reinking.
Reinking, described as a white man with brown hair, opened fire with an AR-15 in the Waffle House parking lot and then stormed the restaurant shortly after 3 a.m. Sunday, police say. Four people were killed and four others were injured before a quick-thinking customer wrestled the assault weapon away, preventing more bloodshed. Reinking then disappeared, police said.
Police say about 20 people were in the Waffle House at the time of the shootings. They included people of different races and ethnicities, but the four people killed were minorities_three black and one Hispanic.
It's not clear why Reinking opened fire on restaurant patrons, though he may have ""mental issues,"" Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief Steve Anderson said earlier. He's considered armed and dangerous, because he was known to have owned a handgun authorities have not recovered.
Meanwhile, authorities in Illinois shared past reports suggesting multiple red flags about a disturbed young man with paranoid delusions.
In May 2016, Reinking told deputies from Tazewell County, Illinois, that music superstar Taylor Swift was stalking him and hacking his phone, and that his family was also involved, according to a report released Sunday.
Reinking agreed to go to a local hospital for an evaluation after repeatedly resisting the request, the sheriff's report said.
Another sheriff's report said Reinking barged into a community pool in Tremont, Illinois, last June, and jumped into the water wearing a pink woman's coat over his underwear. Investigators believed he had an AR-15 rifle in his car trunk, but it was never displayed. No charges were filed.
Last July, Reinking was arrested by the U.S. Secret Service after he crossed into a restricted area near the White House and refused to leave, saying he wanted to meet President Donald Trump. Reinking was not armed at the time, but at the FBI's request, state police in Illinois revoked his state firearms card and seized four guns from him, authorities said.
The AR-15 used in the shootings was among the firearms seized.
In August, Reinking told police he wanted to file a report about 20 to 30 people tapping into his computer and phone and people ""barking like dogs"" outside his residence, according to a report.
""There's certainly evidence that there's some sort of mental health issues involved,"" Tazewell County Sheriff Robert Huston said. But he said deputies returned the guns to Reinking's father on the promise that he would ""keep the weapons secure and out of the possession of Travis.""
Reinking's father ""has now acknowledged giving them back"" to his son, Aaron said.
Phone calls to a number listed for the father, Jeffrey Reinking, went unanswered.
It is not clear why Reinking moved recently from Morton, Illinois, and if it had anything to do with being near Swift, who has a home in Nashville. Police say he worked in construction for a while.
Police say Reinking drove into the Waffle House parking lot in his gold Chevy Silverado pickup early Sunday and sat there for about four minutes before opening fire outside the restaurant.
The victims fatally shot in the parking have been identified as Taurean Sanderlin, 29, of Goodlettsville, and Joe Perez, 20, of Nashville.
Sanderlin was an employee at the restaurant.
Perez's mother posted a picture of her son on Facebook and asked for prayers, saying it was the hardest day of her life. ""Me, my husband and sons are broken right now with this loss,"" Trisha Perez said in the post. ""Our lives are shattered.""
Reinking then entered the restaurant and opened fire, police said.
One of the fatally wounded inside was DeEbony Groves, a 21-year student at Nashville's Belmont University. She was remembered as an exceptional student who made the Dean's list, and a tenacious basketball player.
""She was a brilliant young lady, very, very intelligent and a very hard worker,"" Gallatin High School basketball coach Kim Kendrick told The Tennessean.
Akilah Dasilva was also killed inside the restaurant. The 23-year-old from Antioch was a rap artist and music video producer who had such skills behind the camera that he was a favorite among many of Music City's independent musicians and recording labels, The Tennessean reported.
""Music is my life and I will never stop until I achieve my dreams,"" Dasilva said on his Twitter account.
Dasilva's mother told CBS News that her son was a student at Middle Tennessee State University and aspired to be a music engineer.
He was at the restaurant with his girlfriend, 21-year-old Tia Waggoner, the paper reported. Waggoner was wounded and is being treated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Dasilva's family said she underwent surgery and doctors were trying to save her leg.
Police say Sharita Henderson, 24, of Antioch, was wounded and is being treated at VUMC.
Also wounded was James Shaw Jr., a 29-year-old restaurant patron who burned his hand grabbing the hot muzzle of the assault weapon as he wrestled the gun away. A Nashville native who works as a wireless technician for AT&T, Shaw said he was no hero — despite being hailed as one by Nashville Mayor David Briley.
Shaw said he pounced on the suspect out of self-preservation, after making up his mind that ""he was going to have to work to kill me.""

(Photo: Provided by KABB/WOAI via AP)
SAN ANTONIO — At least five people were killed and several others injured in a crash in southwest Texas on Sunday involving a vehicle carrying undocumented immigrants, authorities said.
The accident in Dimmit County, Texas, happened just before noon off Highway 85 in Big Wells, about 90 miles southwest of San Antonio. Officials said the vehicle was traveling more than 100 mph when it ran off the road and caught gravel, causing it to roll over.
Dimmit County Sheriff Marion Boyd said there were 14 people in a Chevrolet Suburban at the time of the crash, and 12 of them were undocumented immigrants. The occupants were ejected, Boyd said. The Suburban was being chased by a Dimmit County deputy, he said.
The chase began with a Border Patrol agent as the vehicle was coming north from the border, then the Dimmit County Sheriff's deputies took over.

Authorities said four people died in the crash, while nine others were injured. One person died at a San Antonio hospital. Eight others were taken to two hospitals.
Boyd said the driver of the Suburban also was injured and was flown to a hospital. He said one passenger was taken into custody.
The driver and passenger probably will face state and federal charges, Boyd said.
The incident comes amid heightened tensions over the treatment of immigrants at the southern border. The Trump administration has said tougher immigration policies — even separating children from their parents — are needed to deter immigrants from coming to the country illegally. Over a six-week period ended in May, about 2,000 children had been separated from their families, administration officials said Friday.

Photograph: HANDOUT/AFP/Getty Images
The daughter of a Swedish bookseller who was seized by Chinese agents while travelling with two European diplomats has said she fears her father is facing years behind bars after police claimed he was involved in “trafficking state secrets”.
Gui Minhai, a 53-year-old Hong Kong publisher who had specialised in gossipy books about China’s political elite, was taken from a Beijing-bound train on the morning of 20 January as he attempted to reach the Swedish embassy for a medical examination.
Sweden’s foreign minister this week attacked China’s “brutal intervention” while Germany’s ambassador to Beijing denounced what he called the unprecedented treatment of an EU citizen. “There is a widespread fear that these violations of international laws … could happen to other EU citizens in the future,” Michael Clauss warned.
Angela Gui, the publisher’s daughter, told the Guardian: “I just hope there will be an update soon. But I have to say that at this point I’m not very optimistic that we’ll have any sort of good news any time soon.”
Mystery continues to surround the politically charged and increasingly surreal saga of Gui Minhai, which began back in October 2015 when he vanished from his holiday home in Thailand.
Gui subsequently reappeared in custody in mainland China, making what supporters condemned as a forced confession to involvement in a fatal hit-and-run incident in 2003. Four other booksellers, including one British citizen, were also seized leading to criticism from politicians in the UK, including then foreign secretary Philip Hammond.
Gui, who became a Swedish citizen in 1992, had seemed close to release last autumn when it emerged he was living under surveillance in the eastern port city of Ningbo. However, those hopes were dashed when he was apprehended for the second time. His current whereabouts are unknown.
The Guardian understands that on the day Gui Minhai was taken, Sweden’s ambassador to China, Anna Lindstedt, went to China’s foreign ministry seeking answers. Swedish diplomats were referred to police in Ningbo who confirmed the bookseller was in detention and suspected of trafficking in state secrets.
Angela Gui said: “There is no way that he would know any state secrets that wouldn’t have anything directly to do with his case. He was in incommunicado detention for two years. So who would have told him these state secrets?”
“I can only guess that it might have something to do with what happened when he was taken the first time. And that whoever ordered this didn’t want this to come out,” she added.
China has dismissed criticism of its treatment of Gui, who supporters say was seeking medical treatment in Beijing because of fears he was suffering from a rare neurological disease.
“The Swedish side should know the case is serious in nature and some Swedish people have played an irresponsible role in this,” foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, told reporters, warning further criticism could damage bilateral relations.
On Thursday an editorial in the Communist party-run tabloid, the Global Times, accused Sweden and Germany of “rudely provoking China’s judicial sovereignty” and claimed both countries should be ashamed of their “imperialist” meddling.
Angela Gui urged more western governments to confront Beijing over her father’s plight. “It’s important to be vocal and public about this and really I would have wished that this would have happened since the very beginning when he was taken 2015. I can’t help but wonder if the international community had been more vocal back then, if we would have this situation today.”
“Nobody knows what is going to happen now. But if China is claiming he committed all these crimes, and if they are not backing down on that, that suggests there’s going to be a trial. And I expect that if there is indeed a trial he will probably get a very long sentence because of the nature of the crimes he is suspected of.”",LEFT

125125,Breitbart,Ben Carson Tours Homeless Shelter in Los Angeles,"Dr. Ben Carson, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), toured a homeless women’s center on Los Angeles’s infamous Skid Row Tuesday as part of a fact-finding mission aimed at tackling homelessness and providing job training for inner-city communities throughout the United States.
According to the Los Angeles Times, Carson also stopped by a faith-based drug treatment residential center in Echo Park after his visit to Skid Row.
“I can’t imagine how anybody could walk through an area like this and not have their heartstrings tugged,” Carson told reporters, according to the Los Angeles Times.
However, the HUD secretary is also under fire for the Trump administration’s proposal to raise public housing rents.
“There is one inescapable imperative driving this reform effort,” Carson said in a call with reporters about a tripling on the cap on rent for the poorest families, according to the Washington Post. “The current system isn’t working very well. Doing nothing is not an option.”
He reportedly added, “Every year, it takes more money, millions of dollars more, to serve the same number of households. It’s clear from a budget perspective and a human point of view that the current system is unsustainable.”
Another proposal by the Trump administration would increase rents by 5 percent.
Ali Alshuailat, who lives in a housing project in Pacoima told local ABC affiliate ABC 7, “Going up five percent is not a compassionate way because a lot of people here, it’s really hard for them to make it a day. They go day by day. And these people want to come in and raise it.”
In a conference call with reporters, Carson reportedly said his proposal would encourage the 4.5 million who benefit from HUD programs to look for higher-paying jobs.
Others have suggested it will only exacerbate the city’s homelessness epidemic.

115984,Fox News,Trump: US will punish Russia with sanctions 'as soon as they very much deserve it',"President Trump told reporters Wednesday evening that the U.S. would levy new sanctions against the Russian government ""as soon as they very much deserve it.""
Trump was responding to a shouted question as he posed for photos with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe following a joint news conference. The president then returned to the microphone to restate his claim that ""there has been nobody tougher on Russia than President Donald Trump.""
""We had a very, very severe ... fight in Syria recently [in February] between our troops and Russian troops and that’s very sad,"" the president said. ""Many people died in that fight.""
""With the media, no matter what I did, it’s never tough enough because that’s their narrative,"" Trump lamented. ""But Russia will tell you there has been nobody tougher than Donald Trump.""
The president spoke one day after an intra-administration quarrel over sanctions erupted in public earlier this week.
The dispute began Sunday, when U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would announce new sanctions directed at Russian companies associated with Syria's chemical weapons program on Monday, ""if he hasn't already.""
Three senior administration officials told The Associated Press that the sanctions would have been announced Friday night, at the same time U.S., French, and British forces launched a missile strike on Syrian President Bashar Assad's chemical weapons facilities. But the sanctions were not ready in time for Trump's statement announcing military, so they were delayed.
The officials said a decision was then made to announce the sanctions as an answer to Russia's response to the strikes. But that plan was re-evaluated and then put on hold over the weekend as it became clear that Russia's response was less robust than anticipated. The officials were not authorized to discuss private administration deliberations publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.
A National Security Council memorandum sent overnight Friday said the new sanctions would be announced soon, but it did not specify a date. Over the next 36 hours, officials began to delve deeper into the proposed sanctions and decided to hold off on anything imminent, but Haley was unaware, the officials said.
After she made her comments on Sunday, the White House informed the Russian embassy that there would not be more sanctions as of now, an administration source told Fox News.
On Monday, a new memo went out from the NSC saying that additional sanctions were under consideration, but no decision had been made. In the face of Haley's refusal to clarify on Sunday, draft language was sent to her suggesting again that she do so, the officials said.
Haley and her office ignored that, so the White House decided to push back, the officials added.
On Tuesday, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told reporters that Haley ""got ahead of the curve"" when she said new sanctions were coming. Kudlow said additional sanctions were under consideration but have yet to be implemented. Of Haley, he said, ""There might have been some momentary confusion about that.""
Haley then issued a terse statement to Fox News: ""With all due respect, I don't get confused.""

86349,CNN,Susan Collins can tell you why not to trust a promise in Washington,"(CNN) You can't trust a promise on Capitol Hill. It just doesn't ever seem to work out.
Take Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who got seemingly ironclad promises in order to sign her crucial vote onto the GOP's tax reform bill (a banner achievement, but the Republicans' only real legislative accomplishment while controlling Congress and the White House). The tax bill also repealed the individual mandate -- the Obamacare requirement that Americans have health insurance or a pay a fine or tax.
One of the things Collins got in exchange for her vote , she said at the time, was the assurance of the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that he would allow a vote on her plan along with Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson to give insurance companies money to help pay for the most expensive patients. Separately, there was to be a vote on a plan by Sens. Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, and Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, to temporarily shield insurance companies from President Donald Trump's unilateral decision to end Obamacare cost-sharing subsidies that helped them provide coverage to 6 million lower-income Americans.
That was back in December. The promise to Collins was for a vote by the end of the year.
But the day after the tax vote, it was clear there would be no vote in 2017, something Collins acknowledged in a December 20 joint statement with Alexander, author of that separate bipartisan bill.
There were already indications Democrats and Republicans in the House might not be on board for the same version of the proposals. Instead, Collins and Alexander said they would introduce the stablilization bills early in 2018 and debate it around the massive ""omnibus"" spending bill lawmakers use to fund the government.
And that brings us to Thursday, nearly a quarter of the way into 2018. Republican leaders on Wednesday released the massive omnibus -- which is thousands of pages long.
Here are a few ways to look at this:
Collins was effectively rolled; McConnell made his promise to get her vote without ever intending to follow through. Events conspired against her; McConnell made the promise, but then just couldn't find a way to schedule the vote. He tried. He really did, but an immigration debate, a guns debate and other things just got in the way.
Specifically, bipartisan agreement that the government should not just turn off its subsidy payments has turned into a fight over abortion . Republicans in the House wanted to add language barring federal funding for abortions to plans offered with government help on the private market. Democrats want to stick with current language that allows abortion coverage in these private plans, but requires a separate payment for such coverage.
So, even though Senate leaders made their promise and Trump told Collins in a phone call over the weekend he supports what's in her bill, for an unrelated reason -- abortion rights -- it will now not be in the omnibus spending bill. There's also a very real question over whether the Collins proposal would result in stabilizing the market, as the Portland Press-Herald in Maine made clear.
The end result (and the lesson for any lawmaker) is the same, however. Collins gave away the valuable thing she had and didn't get what she wanted in return.
She's not the only one. Democrats pledged and promised they would do something to help undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children who signed up for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program
When he created that program, President Barack Obama promised the government would look out for them. When Trump ended the program, Democrats (and a lot of Republicans) promised to do something to fix the problem.
But when it became clear that public opinion as turning away from them, Democrats gave in, agreed to re-open the government in exchange for a debate later on.
Unlike Collins, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer got his debate on immigration. It lasted a week and yielded no legislation, despite some bipartisan proposals. There was an opportunity to add protections for Dreamers in the omnibus, too, but they were also left out.
Again, the lesson here is that if you really want something in Washington, you're going to have to use up everything you've got in order to get it. And you're going to have to get it in hand before you give away your leverage.
Because the days of grand bipartisan debates in which lawmakers hash things out on the Senate or House floor are something of a myth at the moment.",UNDEFINED
68860,USA Today,These are America’s drunkest states,"CLOSE Drinking alcohol is a part of many of our lives no matter where you live. But alcohol abuse can take its toll on not only your health, but the economy as well. Buzz60

Excessive drinking can lead to a variety of health problems and significantly shorten a person’s life. The habit claims nearly 90,000 lives each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And those who die as the result of alcohol abuse do so 30 years prematurely, on average.
Excessive alcohol consumption, according to the CDC, includes binge drinking and heavy drinking. Binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks in a single occasion for women and five or more for men, and heavy drinking is defined as at least eight drinks per week for women and 15 for men.
Nationwide, 18.0% of American adults drink an excessive amount of alcohol. However, the excessive drinking rate ranges considerably across states. In some states, just over 1 in 10 adults drink too much on a regular basis, while in others, the share is closer to 1 in 4.
More: Alcohol abuse: The drunkest city in every state
24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from the CDC to identify the states reporting the highest levels of adults who binge drink or drink heavily.
50. Tennessee
Adults drinking excessively: 11.2%
Alcohol-related driving deaths: 28.0% (11th lowest)
Adults in fair or poor health: 19.9% (9th highest)
Drunkest metro area: Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin
Binge or heavy drinking is less of a problem in Tennessee than in any other state. However, it is not a rarity either as 11.2% of the adult population drinks excessively. Nationwide, a much higher percentage of adults report excessive drinking, at 18.0%.
Excessive drinking over time can lead to a myriad serious and potentially fatal health issues, including certain cancers, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease. Despite the relatively few adults who binge drink or drink heavily, Tennessee has one of the highest premature death rates of any state. For every 100,000 state residents, 436 die before age 75, the eighth highest premature death rate among states. Perhaps the adult smoking rate of 21.9% — the seventh highest share among all states — contributes to the higher premature death rate.
49. West Virginia
Adults drinking excessively: 11.4%
Alcohol-related driving deaths: 32.0% (25th lowest)
Adults in fair or poor health: 23.7% (the highest)
Drunkest metro area: Morgantown, WV
Only 11.4% of adults binge or heavily drink in West Virginia, much less than the 18.0% of adults who binge or heavily drink nationwide. States with lower excessive drinking rates are often home to lower income populations; and West Virginia is no exception. The state’s median household income of $43,385 is well below the median household income nationwide of $57,617, and the second lowest of any state.
Alcohol consumption is just one of many behavioral factors that can affect health outcomes and as a result, areas with low excessive drinking rates are not necessarily the healthiest. In West Virginia, nearly 24% of adults are in fair or poor health, the largest share of any state.
48. Utah
Adults drinking excessively: 12.4%
Alcohol-related driving deaths: 19.7% (the lowest)
Adults in fair or poor health: 12.9% (6th lowest)
Drunkest metro area: Salt Lake City, UT
In Utah, 12.4% of adults report excessive drinking, well below the 18.0% share of adults nationwide who either binge drink or drink heavily. States with a lower share of adults drinking excessively tend to have lower rates of alcohol-related driving deaths. Only 19.7% of driving deaths in Utah involve alcohol, the lowest alcohol-related driving death rate of any state and far below nationwide rate of 30.0%.
Low excessive drinking rates in Utah are partially attributable to religious faith. Over half of the state’s population identify as Mormon, a religion that expressly forbids alcohol consumption.

47. Alabama
Adults drinking excessively: 13.0%
Alcohol-related driving deaths: 29.4% (17th lowest)
Adults in fair or poor health: 21.2% (4th highest)
Drunkest metro area: Auburn-Opelika, AL
In Alabama, 13.0% of adults drink to excess on a regular basis. This is a considerably lower share than the 18.0% of adults who binge or drink heavily nationwide. Although excessive drinking can lead to serious health problems, including liver cancer and cardiovascular disease, states with lower shares of adults drinking excessively are often less healthy than states reporting higher shares of excessive drinking. An estimated 21.2% of adults in Alabama are in fair or poor health, the fourth largest share of any state.
Alcohol consumption is only one factor that can affect health. While Alabama adults drink less, many struggle with other health issues. For example, an estimated 34.0% of adults are obese, the fifth highest share among states.

Adults drinking excessively: 13.3%
Alcohol-related driving deaths: 23.3% (3rd lowest)
Adults in fair or poor health: 22.2% (3rd highest)
Drunkest metro area: Gulfport-Biloxi-Pascagoula, MS
Just 13.3% of adults in this Southern state binge or heavily drink, much less than the comparable national share of 18.0%. Despite the link between excessive drinking and a myriad of health problems, states with lower drinking rates tend to report worse health outcomes than states with higher drinking rates. In Mississippi, 22.2% of adults report being in fair or poor health — the third largest share of any state. This could be a function of income, as states with lower drinking rates also tend to have lower incomes, and poorer states generally report poorer health outcomes. Mississippi has the lowest median household income of all states at $41,754 a year and the highest poverty rate at 20.8%.
While excessive drinking is never healthy, it is only one behavioral factor that can affect health. For example, lack of exercise can lead to obesity and heart problems, and in Mississippi, 31.9% of adults lead completely sedentary lives, the highest share among all states and well above the national average of 22.0%.
45. New Mexico
Adults drinking excessively: 13.8%
Alcohol-related driving deaths: 32.1% (25th highest)
Adults in fair or poor health: 20.2% (8th highest)
Drunkest metro area: Santa Fe, NM
Some 13.8% of adults in New Mexico binge drink or drink heavily, a smaller share than the 18.0% of American adults who do. Despite the lower excessive drinking rate, the state reports poorer health outcomes such as an above average premature death rate and a higher share of adults reporting being in fair or poor health.
In general, states that have smaller shares of adults who drink heavily are likely to have lower incomes. New Mexico is one such example with a median household income of $46,748 a year, nearly $11,000 below the national figure of $57,617 and the seventh lowest median income nationwide. New Mexico also has the third highest poverty among all states at 19.8%.
44. Oklahoma
Adults drinking excessively: 13.9%
Alcohol-related driving deaths: 29.9% (19th lowest)
Adults in fair or poor health: 20.9% (6th highest)
Drunkest metro area: Lawton, OK
Nearly 14% of adults in Oklahoma drink excessively — below the national average of 18%. Over time, binge or heavy drinking can lead to many health problems. However, excessive drinking is only one of many factors that can contribute to poor health. Adults in Oklahoma are much more likely to be physically inactive and smoke than the typical American. Partially as a result, despite a lower binge and heavy drinking rate, about 1 in 4 adults in the state are in fair or poor health, the sixth highest share of any state.

Adults drinking excessively: 14.9%
Alcohol-related driving deaths: 32.3% (24th highest)
Adults in fair or poor health: 18.5% (12th highest)
Drunkest metro area: Jacksonville, NC
Nationwide, 18% of adults drink excessively. In North Carolina, that share is much lower at 15%. Drinking too much alcohol on a regular basis can lead to many health complications — both short and long term — ranging from alcohol poisoning to certain cancers. Despite the lower percentage of adults drinking to excess, 18.5% of adults in North Carolina report being in poor or fair health, the 12th highest share of any state and well above the national average of 15%. One possible explanation for poorer health outcomes in North Carolina may be above average physical inactivity and obesity rates at 24.0% and 29.7%, respectively. Nationwide, 22% of adults get no exercise beyond getting up and going to work and 28% of adults are obese.
42. Arkansas
Adults drinking excessively: 15.3%
Alcohol-related driving deaths: 28.4% (13th lowest)
Adults in fair or poor health: 22.7% (2nd highest)
Drunkest metro area: Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers, AR-MO
Some 15.3% of adults in Arkansas drink to excess, which is below the national average of 18.0%. States where binge drinking and drinking heavily are less common tend to have poorer health outcomes, despite the many negative health problems associated with excessive alcohol consumption. Drinking alcohol is an expensive unhealthy habit and tends to be less common in states with lower incomes — which often report worse health outcomes than wealthier states.
Arkansas is no different. The state’s median annual household income of $44,334 is well below the national figure of $57,617. Some 22.7% of adults in the state report being in fair or poor health, the second largest share among all states.
41. Idaho
Adults drinking excessively: 15.4%
Alcohol-related driving deaths: 32.4% (23rd highest)
Adults in fair or poor health: 14.1% (14th lowest)
Drunkest metro area: Coeur d’Alene, ID
Only 15.4% of adults in Idaho drink excessively, a smaller share than the 18.0% of adults nationwide. Excessive drinking is never healthy and Idaho’s low excessive drinking rate partially explains some positive health outcomes. A key measure of health is the premature death rate, and Idaho’s is below average. For every 100,000 state residents, 310 die before the age of 75. Nationwide, there are 333 deaths before age 75 for every 100,000 people.
According to the CDC, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to risky sexual behavior — and Idaho’s low excessive drinking rate may partially explain a low incidence of sexually transmitted diseases. There are 337 diagnoses of chlamydia per 100,000 state residents annually, one the lowest such rates among states and well below the U.S. rate of 456 per 100,000.
40. Maryland
Adults drinking excessively: 15.5%
Alcohol-related driving deaths: 32.8% (20th highest)
Adults in fair or poor health: 13.3% (8th lowest)
Drunkest metro area: California-Lexington Park, MD
Some 15.5% of adults in Maryland binge drink or drink heavily, which is less than the national share of American adults who drink in excess at 18.0%. According to the CDC, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to depression and anxiety — and Maryland’s low excessive drinking rate may help explain better than average mental health outcomes. Adults in the state report an average of just 3.4 mentally unhealthy days per month, fewer than the 3.7-day national average.
States with smaller shares of adults who drink excessively tend to have lower median household incomes. Maryland, however, is the exception. The median annual household income in the state of $78,945 is the highest of any state and over $20,000 above the national median of $57,617.

Nationwide, 18% of adults drink to excess, whereas in Nevada, only 15.8% of adults binge drink or drink heavily. Drinking large quantities of alcohol can lead to many health issues, yet states with lower shares of adults drinking excessively tend to be less healthy than those with higher shares. For example, the premature death rate is higher in Nevada than in most states — likely due to several factors other than alcohol consumption. For every 100,000 people in Nevada, 360 die before the age of 75.

Binge drinking or drinking heavily are not healthy habits. Despite this, states with a lower portion of adults who drink in excess tend to report poorer health outcomes than those with larger portions of adults who drink excessively. In Arizona, 16% of adults engage in binge drinking or drinking heavily, less than the national average of 18%. Despite the lower excessive drinking rate, 18.5% of adults in the state report they are in fair or poor health, the 11th highest share of any state.

Adults in fair or poor health: 20.9% (7th highest)
Drunkest metro area: Louisville/Jefferson County, KY-IN
Some 16.3% of Kentucky adults drink to excess, which is less than the comparable national share of 18.0%. Excessive drinking can lead to a slew of health conditions such as hypertension and liver disease. However, states with lower shares of adults who binge drink or drink heavily are typically less healthy than those with higher shares of adults who drink excessively. In Kentucky, nearly 21% of adults report they are in fair or poor health, the seventh highest share of all states. This could be because many of the states that report lower excessive drinking rates have lower incomes — and states with lower incomes and higher poverty rates tend to report less healthful behavior and worse health outcomes than wealthier states.
This appears to be the case in Kentucky, which is one of the poorest states in the country. The state reports 25.9% smoking rate among adults, the highest of any state. Also, 32.9% of state adults are obese, which is well above the national obesity rate of 28%.

Some 16.6% of adults in South Carolina binge drink or drink heavily, which is below the 18% share of American adults who drink to excess. States with low incomes and high poverty rates tend to report worse health outcomes than wealthier states, and this is the case in South Carolina. The median income of households in the state is $49,501 a year, which is well below the nationwide median household income of $57,617. The poverty rate in South Carolina is 15.3%, one of the higher state poverty rates.
While drinking too much alcohol is unhealthy, it is only one factor that can cause adverse health effects. Obesity and smoking are some of the other factors. In South Carolina, 31.8% of adults are obese — the ninth highest share of any state — and the smoking rate is higher than the national average.

Typically, states where the excessive drinking rate is lower also have lower shares of deaths from alcohol-involved car crashes. Despite a lower share of adults who drink excessively, 37.9% of all deaths from car crashes in South Carolina are related to alcohol consumption, the sixth highest share of any state.

Drunkest metro area: Bloomington, IN
A total of 16.8% of Indiana adults drink to excess, less than the national excessive drinking rate of 18%. Binge or heavy drinking can lead to many health issues, including high blood pressure, stroke, and long-term memory problems. Like many states reporting lower excessive drinking rates, incomes are lower in Indiana. The median household income of $52,314 a year, below the national median household income of $57,617.
Despite the relatively low excessive drinking rate in Indiana, the premature death rate in the state of 387 deaths before the age of 75 for every 100,000 people is the 10th highest. This is likely — at least in part — the result of the high obesity rate in the state, which at 31.7% is also the 10th highest of all states. Earning a low income makes it challenging to afford healthful food and and exercise opportunities, and the state’s low income helps explain its high obesity rate.

The national share of adults who drink excessive amounts of alcohol is 18%. In Virginia, 17.4% of adults report drinking to excess. States with lower portions of adults binge drinking or drinking heavily tend to report less healthy outcomes. That is likely because many of these states are generally poorer — and low income states tend to report worse health than wealthier states. The opposite is true for Virginia, however. The state’s median household income of $68,114 a year is well above the national median, and the poverty rate is just 11%. The nationwide poverty rate is 14%.
Partially due to the state’s higher incomes, Virginia adults tend to be quite healthy, reporting below-average obesity, smoking, and premature death rates.

Similar to Virginia, 17.4% of adults in Florida also drink excessively. Typically, states with below average shares of adults who binge drink or drink heavily have lower incomes and higher poverty rates. In Florida, the median household income of $50,860 a year is about $6,800 less than the national figure. Those with lower incomes often lack access to luxuries including alcohol and healthy foods. A diet that lacks a diversity of nutritious foods can result in poor health outcomes, which helps explain why 17.1% of adults in Florida report they are in fair or poor health. For perspective, only 15% of American adults report they are in fair or poor health.

Despite a lower frequency of adults drinking heavily, 35.3% of deaths from car crashes involve alcohol, the 10th highest share of any state. This factor, along with a higher smoking rate, may contribute to the above average premature death rate in Wyoming. Some 347 people die before age 75 for every 100,000 people in Wyoming, which is higher than the nationwide rate of about 333 premature deaths per every 100,000 Americans.

The median household income in the state of $76,126 a year is the third highest income among all states. Likely because those with higher incomes are able to afford better access to health care and healthy lifestyles, New Jersey reports some of the better health outcomes nationwide. The state’s obesity, smoking, and premature death rates are lower than the comparable national rates.

Adults in fair or poor health: 15.8% (24th highest)
Drunkest metro area: Providence-Warwick, RI-MA
A total of 17.9% of adults in Rhode Island drink to excess — just below the national share of adults binge drinking or drinking heavily at 18%. States where adults drink at near the national rate also tend to have to report alcohol-related driving deaths similar to the country as a whole. In Rhode Island, however, some 40.4% of driving deaths were due to alcohol, the third highest alcohol-related driving death rate of any state and well above the national rate of 30%.
22. California
Adults drinking excessively: 18.0%
Alcohol-related driving deaths: 29.0% (15th lowest)
Adults in fair or poor health: 17.8% (15th highest)
Drunkest metro area: Chico, CA
Some 18% of adults in California drink excessively, equivalent to the national excessive drinking rate. Wealthier states tend to report better health outcomes, likely because of better health care access and the ability to afford healthier lifestyles. In California, the median household income of $67,739 a year is nearly $10,000 greater than the national income of $57,617 and one of the wealthiest states in America.
Despite higher rates of drinking excessively, adults in California are some of the healthiest in all the country. Only 22.7% of adults are obese, the third lowest share among all states and well below the national obesity rate of 28.0%. In addition, only 11.7% of adults smoke, the second lowest share nationwide. Both low obesity and smoking rates may have positively contributed to the state’s low premature death rate. At 468 deaths before age 75 for every 100,000 state residents, it is the third lowest premature death rate of any state.

Drunkest metro area: State College, PA
An estimated 18.1% of adults in Pennsylvania drink excessively, which slightly surpasses the national rate of 18%. Excessive drinking can lead to several serious health issues including cardiovascular disease and liver cancer. In Pennsylvania, where the excessive drinking rate is just slightly higher than the national rate, the premature death rate is also just slightly higher. For every 100,000 Pennsylvania residents, about 342 die before the age of 75, slightly more than the nationwide rate of 333 premature deaths per every 100,000.

Drunkest metro area: Watertown-Fort Drum, NY
At 18.2%, New York’s excessive drinking rate is roughly in line with that of the national share of 18%. Despite the fact that a slightly larger share of adults drink heavily or binge drink, driving deaths attributable to alcohol are rare compared to most states. Only 23% of all roadway fatalities involve alcohol, the second lowest share among any state and well below the national rate of 30%.

Adults drinking excessively: 18.4%
Alcohol-related driving deaths: 31.2% (22nd lowest)
Adults in fair or poor health: 11.5% (2nd lowest)
Drunkest metro area: Manchester-Nashua, NH
New Hampshire’s excessive drinking rate of 18.4% is slightly higher than the national figure of 18%. Despite a slightly above average excessive drinking rate, a strong majority of adults in New Hampshire report they are in good health. Only 11.5% report being in fair or poor health — the second lowest share of any state. The premature death rate is also quite low in New Hampshire, with 290 deaths before the age of 75, per every 100,000 residents, also one of the lowest shares among the states. With smoking being one of the leading causes of premature death, it is possible that the low smoking rate of just 15.9% — well below the national smoking rate of 18.0% — contributes to the lower premature death rate and better health outcomes overall.
18. Connecticut

Alcohol-related driving deaths: 33.4% (18th highest)
Adults in fair or poor health: 14.3% (17th lowest)
Drunkest metro area: Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk, CT
Alcohol is not cheap, and wealthy individuals are more likely than lower-income individuals to be able to afford drinking on a regular basis. Connecticut is one of the wealthier states with a median household income of $73,433 a year, which greatly exceeds the comparable national income of $57,617. Some 18.6% of adults in the state binge or heavily drink, more than the comparable national share of 18%.
Despite the fact that excessive drinking is a common habit in the state, adults in Connecticut tend to report healthy outcomes. Of all adults in the state, about 1 in 4 are obese, one of the lowest obesity rates among all states and well below the national rate of 28.0%. In addition, only 13.5% of adults reportedly smoke, the third lowest rate of any state.

Drunkest metro area: Houma-Thibodaux, LA
Some 18.8% of adults in Louisiana drink excessively, more than the 18% of adults who drink to excess nationwide. States with higher excessive drinking rates tend to be wealthier, at least in part because alcohol can be costly. In Louisiana, however, the median household income of $45,156 a year is well below the comparable national income of $57,617. The poverty rate in Louisiana is also incredibly high. At 20.2%, it is the second highest poverty rate among states and well above the the national rate of 14%.
Binge or heavy drinking can lead to a slew of health issues such as hypertension and cancer. Perhaps the high drinking rate in Louisiana contributes to the high premature death rate. For every 100,000 residents, 452 die before age 75, the sixth highest share among the states.

Drunkest metro area: Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, OR-WA
Some 18.8% of adults in Oregon binge or heavily drink, more than the national share of 18%. States with higher drinking rates tend to report better health outcomes, likely because they are also higher-income states. In Oregon, however, adults report relatively good health outcomes, despite both an average drinking rate and a median household income that is close to the national figure.
For example, only 15.3% of adults lead sedentary lives, the second lowest share among states and well below the national rate of 22%. The high rate of adults in Oregon who routinely engage in physical activity has likely contributed to the state’s low obesity rate. Only 26.4% of adults are obese in Oregon — below the nationwide obesity rate of 28%.

An estimated 19.1% of adults in Colorado drink excessively, a larger share than in most states and more than the 18% excessive drinking rate nationwide. Despite a greater likelihood of alcohol abuse, adults in Colorado are healthier than most Americans by other important measures. For example, just 14.4% of adults in the state lead sedentary lives, the smallest share of any state and well below the 22% physical inactivity rate nationwide. Active lifestyles partly explain some healthy outcomes in Colorado. Just 20.2% of the state’s adult population are obese, the smallest share of any state.

72208,BBC,Northamptonshire County Council: £10m public health grant probe,"Image caption Northamptonshire County Council received more than £70m in funding from Public Health England over a two-year period
A council dubbed the ""worst-run in the country"" is under investigation over allegations it used millions of pounds ring-fenced for public health to prop up other services.
Northamptonshire County Council is in talks with Public Health England about the possible ""claw-back"" of up to £10m.
It comes after the authority voted for almost £40m in budget cuts.
Conservative council leader Heather Smith said the ""money may have been spent in adult social care"".
She added: ""It is debatable whether that was a public health need or not.""
The county council received more than £70m in funding from Public Health England over a two-year period.
It was meant to be used only for specific purposes, such as health education and smoking cessation services.
A county council spokesman confirmed discussions with Public Health England were ongoing around ""how the public health grant was used within public services"" during 2015-16 and 2016-17.
Mrs Smith said any repayments would be staged over a number of years.
The news was disclosed to councillors by officers during closed-door sessions in the run-up to the recent budget, which approved cuts to library services and bus subsidies.
Mrs Smith said the money ""may have been spent in adult social care, looking after people in some way or another"".
Image caption County council leader Heather Smith said money from the Public Health England grant ""may have been spent on adult social care""
Opposition Labour finance spokesman Mick Scrimshaw said: ""Everybody knows the county council has financial problems and in particular around the issues of funding for adult social care, but it beggars belief.""
He said councillors were not given specifics regarding ""the allegations of misspending,"" but were told the amount involved may be ""significantly more"" than the original figure of £10m mentioned.
Last month, the county council brought in a section 114 notice preventing all new expenditure in 2017/18, except on services for the most vulnerable.
Kettering MP Philip Hollobone told the House of Commons the issuing of the notice meant Northamptonshire ""becomes the worst-run in the country"".
Image caption Next year's county council budget will see £39.2m of cuts made, including the closure of 21 small libraries
""Whether that decision was right or wrong will come out,"" she said, but added that the money ""wasn't misappropriated"".
""At the end of the day it's still being spent on the people in Northamptonshire,"" she said.
Public Health England confirmed talks were taking place with the council, but added it could not confirm the sums involved ""until discussions are concluded"".
The director of public health in Northamptonshire between May 2013 and April 2017, Dr Akeem Ali, said there were attempts to access public health money by other departments within the county council ""without using the application process"".
'Open and transparent'
He added: ""I did not sign off inappropriate use of Public Health Grant while I was director of public health.""
Papers for the county council's cabinet meeting on Tuesday show the authority is planning to bring its outsourced public health delivery vehicle, First for Wellbeing, back in-house.
One reason given for this is that Public Health England is ""reviewing the historic and current use of the Public Health grant"".
A county council spokesman said the authority was unable to confirm who authorised for the grant to be spent on other services ""while discussions are ongoing"".
He added the council's new director of public health and Public Health England ""are being full, open and transparent with each other,"" but said he could not provide detail publicly on the amount of money involved.",UNDEFINED
119221,Breitbart,"Mosher: Pompeo Goes to Pyongyang, Playing the Trump Card","In July 1971, President Richard Nixon’s National Security Advisor, Henry Kissinger, secretly flew from Pakistan to Beijing. Kissinger’s negotiations led directly to Nixon’s historic visit to China some months later.
Nixon had reshuffled the diplomatic deck and played the China card. As a result, the strategic calculus that had governed the Cold War for decades underwent a tectonic shift in America’s favor.
Now we learn that CIA Director Mike Pompeo secretly met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un on Easter weekend. President Trump has confirmed that Pompeo’s negotiations have laid the groundwork for a summit in late May or early June to discuss the rogue state’s nuclear weapons program. “Denuclearization would be a great thing for the world, as well as for North Korea,” the President tweeted.
Like Nixon, Trump is boldly reshuffling the deck. And, in like manner, the strategic calculus that has governed the standoff on the Korean Peninsula for decades is starting to shift in our favor.
In January, Kim Jong-un suddenly agreed to talks with the South, and in February sent a team to South Korea’s Winter Olympics. The first summit between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Kim will take place on April 27. In a further surprise, the North Korean dictator has apparently agreed to discuss formally ending the Korean War, which began when his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, invaded the south some 68 years ago.
The most startling news is that Pyongyang, according to South Korea’s president, has just agreed to Trump’s demand for “complete denuclearization.” And this without any strings attached, such as the withdrawal of American troops.
Kim Jong-un was even galvanized — again by Trump, of course – to venture beyond the borders of his hermit kingdom for the first time since assuming power in 2011. In late March, Kim visited his chief international patron (and fellow president for life), Chinese President Xi Jinping.
According to the Nikkei Asian Review, Xi talked to Kim about the ongoing power struggle between the U.S. and China, and what it means in the context of something called “Project 2035.” Project 2035 is a grand scheme for building China into a “great modern socialist country” by the year 2035. Announced at last October’s National Party Congress, its goal is a China that is stronger in both economic and military terms than the United States.
Why would Xi share his “China Dream” of one day becoming the world’s dominant power with Kim? Perhaps to remind him that at the present time, in the face of renewed U.S. confidence, economic growth, and military resolve, it is better to be conciliatory with Trump. “I’m playing the long game,” he may have suggested to Kim. “You should, too.”
None of this would have happened if the hapless Hillary Clinton had been elected. Like previous American presidents, she would probably have tried to once again bribe North Korea into behaving itself. And like previous presidents from her husband on, she would have only thereby encouraged further extortionate behavior.
It is Trump’s toughness that has gotten us this far. Instead of bribing North Korea to suspend its weapons and missile programs, he is choking it (and its giant neighbor to the north) with ever-tightening sanctions.
Bolstering the sanctions regime is the threat of military action, made credible by the near-annihilation of the Islamic State and the surgical strikes in Syria, among other things. Young Kim knows that, if a denuclearization agreement can’t be hammered out, that he might wake up one morning to find his nuclear and missile facilities a smoldering ruin.
We used to say that only Nixon, with his strong anti-communist credentials, could have gone to China.
It may well turn out to be the case that only Trump, with his steely resolve, can broker a deal with Kim.
It is still early days, but the end of the Korean War and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would fundamentally change the strategic calculus of East Asia.
Of course, Nixon going to China was not an unmixed blessing. Although the U.S.-China détente increased the pressure on the Soviet Union while helping hundreds of millions of Chinese escape poverty, it also contributed to the rise of a Chinese Party-State that is increasingly hostile to everything America stands for.
In the case of North Korea, our goal must be to (1) convince Little Rocket Man to give up his dangerous toys and (2) reconcile himself to living with his southern neighbors in peace. In so doing, we should be careful not to strengthen his despotic regime which – with or without nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles – will continue to repress its own people.
With the North Korean threat off the strategic chessboard, America and its allies can focus on the real danger to the present world order: China itself.

18710,The Guardian,Fear now rules Trump’s US. It’s what drives the president too,"“I alone can do it.” These five extraordinary words kept coming back to me as I reflected on Donald Trump’s first year as president of the US. He made this claim during his speech accepting the Republican nomination in July 2016. At the time, it struck me simply as a delusional expression of his grandiosity. Looking back, I also hear the plaintive wail of a desperate child who believes he is alone in the world with no one to care for him. “I alone can do it” is Trump’s survival response to: “I must do it all alone.”
There are two Trumps. The one he presents to the world is all bluster, bullying and certainty. The other, which I have long felt haunts his inner world, is the frightened child of a relentlessly critical and bullying father and a distant and disengaged mother who couldn’t or wouldn’t protect him.
“That’s why I’m so screwed up, because I had a father who pushed me so hard,” Trump acknowledged in 2007, in a brief and rare moment of self-awareness.

Trump’s temperament and his habits have hardened with age. He was always cartoonish, but compared with the man for whom I wrote The Art of the Deal 30 years ago, he is significantly angrier today: more reactive, deceitful, distracted, vindictive, impulsive and, above all, self-absorbed – assuming the last is possible.
This is the narrative I’ve been advancing for the past 18 months. With the recent publication of Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury, it turns out that even those closest to Trump recognise his utter lack of fitness to be president, even if they are too cowed and cowardly to do anything about it.
Fear is the hidden through-line in Trump’s life – fear of weakness, of inadequacy, of failure, of criticism and of insignificance. He has spent his life trying to outrun these fears by “winning” – as he puts it – and by redefining reality whenever the facts don’t serve the narrative he seeks to create. It hasn’t worked, but not for lack of effort.
In his first year in office, Trump has lambasted any facts he dislikes as “fake news”, while making nearly 2,000 false or misleading claims of his own – more than five a day. In a single half-hour interview with the New York Times in late December, he made 24 such claims. This is the very definition of gaslighting – lying until you get people to doubt their own reality – and it is both frightening and disturbing. Because the office Trump now occupies makes him the most powerful man on Earth, his fears, and the way he manages them, have necessarily become ours.
We fear Trump because he is impulsive, irrational and self-serving, but above all because he seems unconstrained by even the faintest hint of conscience. Trump feels no more shame over his most destructive behaviours than a male lion does killing the cubs of his predecessor when he takes over a pride.
Trump has made fear the dominant emotion of our times. This, I believe, is his primary impact on the body politic after a year in office. He began his campaign by describing immigrant Mexicans as rapists, Muslims as terrorists, and more recently all black and brown people, and entire countries, as inferior. Trump skilfully exploited the fears of supporters who felt powerless and disenfranchised by presenting himself as their angry champion, even though the policies he has since pursued are likely to make their lives worse.
About the only thing Trump truly has in common with his base is that he feels every bit as aggrieved as they do, despite his endless privilege. No amount of money, fame or power has been enough to win him the respect he so insatiably craves. His anger over this perceived injustice is visceral and authentic. Trump’s unwinding of government programmes such as Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act will fuel yet more fear among the millions of people will lose their health care in the year ahead. The tax plan Trump pushed through most benefits him, his family and his fellow billionaires and provides the least relief to those who need it most. In both cases, the victims of these policies will include millions of his supporters who may find someone else to blame, but whose suffering will inexorably increase.
xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg""> The Trumpian world view is narrow, dark and deficit-driven
The fearful divide Trump has exacerbated is not simply between his supporters and his detractors, the rich and the poor, or Democrats and Republicans, but between the best and the worst in each of us.
In the face of fear, it is a physiological fact that our most primitive and selfish instincts emerge. Control of our behaviour shifts from the prefrontal cortex to the emotionally driven amygdala – sometimes referred to as “fear central”. As we move into fight-or-flight mode, we become more self-centred, and our vision narrows to the perceived threat, which in the modern world is less to our survival than to our sense of value and worthiness. We lose the capacity for empathy, rationality, proportionality and attention to the longer-term consequences of our actions.
This is the reactive state Trump has tapped into with his followers and which he has prompted in his opponents. It serves none of us well. Think for a moment about the immense difference between how you feel and behave at your best and your worst. It is when we feel safest and most secure that we think most clearly and expansively. It’s also when we are most inclined to look beyond our self-interest, and to act with compassion, generosity, consideration and forgiveness.
I have never observed any of these qualities in Trump. Over the past year I have frequently been asked whether he has any redeeming qualities. I’ve thought about this as objectively as I can, and the only one I’ve come up with is his relentless drive. But because Trump uses this quality solely in the service of his self-aggrandisement and domination, it scarcely qualifies as a virtue.
So what does resistance to Trump look like? This is a question that has preoccupied me and millions of other Americans this past year. If fear gets sufficiently intense, or persists for long enough, we eventually move into “freeze” – meaning numbness and submission. This is my own greatest fear. As Trump violates one norm after another day after day, the risk is that we lose our sense of outrage and our motivation to speak out.
The challenge we face is to resist our own fear without sacrificing our outrage. That requires widening our perspective beyond Trump’s, and beyond Trump himself. The future is ours to shape, not his. Dispiriting as I found it to write The Art of the Deal with a man I progressively came to view as a black hole, the experience prompted me to redirect my life in almost complete opposition to the values and world view that he represents. My own path over the past two decades – prompted in reaction to my experience with him – has been to help business leaders become more wholly human, and to humanise workplaces.
Trump’s actions over the past year have already prompted an extraordinary wave of new activism among people in their 20s and 30s, who are now the biggest segment of the US electorate, and represent the next generation of leaders. The 19 women who stepped forward to accuse Trump of sexual assault have helped to galvanise a rapidly growing, worldwide movement to empower women and to call out sexual abuse in the workplace. Thanks in large part to Trump, hundreds of new female candidates are now running for political office.

Trump himself has become the embodiment of the limits of traditional masculinity. “We raise boys,” writes the author Terrence Real, “to live in a world in which they are either winners or losers, grandiose or shame-filled, … perpetrators or victims. Society shows little mercy for men if they fail in the performance of their role. But the price of that performance is an inward sickness.”
Trump represents an extreme version of a sickness from which most men suffer, to some extent. The most powerful stand we can take in opposition to Trump’s values and behaviour is to pursue a higher purpose every day, seek more common ground amid our differences, and find better ways to take care of others and add value wherever we can. As he looks backward, we must look forward.
The Trumpian worldview is narrow, dark and deficit-driven. Each of us shares some of those instincts: the fear of inadequacy is uniquely and universally human. But we are also capable of so much more. My hope and belief is that Trump will no longer be president by this year’s end. My personal commitment is to pay much less attention to him, and more to making a difference to others affected by his policies. Whatever happens, may the worst of Trump inspire the best in us.
We, together, can do it.

141153,The Guardian,Five Star and League move closer to forming Italian government,"Prime minister expected to be chosen from one of two populist parties after talks prove positive
The Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League have edged closer towards forming a government in Italy in a move that would pave the way for a prime minister from one of the two populist parties.
Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League, and his M5S counterpart, Luigi Di Maio, said in a joint statement that talks early on Thursday on defining a government programme and setting priorities had been positive.
They said significant progress on the cabinet’s composition and who would lead it had also been made “in view of constructive collaboration between the parties with the aim of deciding everything as quickly as possible in order to give a response and a government to the country”.
Giancarlo Giorgetti, a politician with the League for more than 20 years who has been mooted as a potential prime minister, was also at the meeting, as was Vincenzo Spadafora, a deputy with M5S.
Although Salvini and Di Maio are not entirely out of the running, others mentioned in the Italian media as potential prime ministers include Enrico Giovannini, a former chief statistician at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and Giulia Bongiorno, a lawyer who made a name for herself after her defence of Giulio Andreotti, a former prime minister found guilty in 2002 of complicity in a mafia-linked hit against a journalist.
Bongiorno also defended Raffaele Sollecito, who alongside the American Amanda Knox was cleared in 2015 of murdering the British student Meredith Kercher.

Salvini, who has mostly campaigned on an anti-immigration platform, could potentially take the role of interior minister with Di Maio as foreign minister.
The role of integration minister, scrapped by Matteo Renzi’s government in 2014, may also be re-established and filled by Toni Iwobi, a League politician who became Italy’s first black senator when he was elected in March.
A meeting between the two parties’ technical representatives will be held later on Thursday, the statement said.
The latest development breaks the nine-week stalemate that prevailed after inconclusive national elections in March, but was only made possible after the former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose Forza Italia party had teamed up with the League as part of a centre-right coalition that won the largest share of the vote, agreed to step aside late on Wednesday.
Berlusconi, 81, had been the stumbling block in earlier negotiations between the League and M5S, with the four-time ex-prime minister seen as a potent symbol of the corruption they have campaigned against.
The Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, on Wednesday gave the two parties a 24-hour deadline after they unexpectedly sought more time to clinch an agreement amid the threat of a caretaker government.
It is unclear when the two parties, which between them won more than 50% of the March vote, will announce their programme and cabinet lineup, although Di Maio is reportedly ready to ask Mattarella to give them until 20 May.",LEFT

139028,ABC News,Study finds little bang for the buck in Zika blood testing,"Screening blood donations for the Zika virus netted only a few infections at a cost of more than $5 million for each positive test result, according to new research.
The study was the first large look at the impact of guidelines set two years ago, when the Zika epidemic was an unfolding menace in the U.S. and health officials were scrambling to prevent new infections.
The study, published Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine, found that the blood donation testing requirements offered little bang for the buck. It also raised questions about whether a cheaper testing method should be used.
In more than 4 million blood donations checked in the United States, nine tested positive for the Zika virus. Of those, three were considered an infection threat.
""We can't afford to spend that kind of money to find a single case,"" said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University infectious diseases expert who was not involved in the research.
Zika infections swept across Latin America and the Caribbean in 2015 and 2016, with a few very small outbreaks in the southern United States. The virus is mainly spread by tropical mosquitoes, but scientists also discovered some infections were spread through sex.
Fearing Zika might also spread through transfusions, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2016 called on all blood banks to screen for it.
""The risk from transfusion was poorly known. We put this testing in place as a precaution without really having solid data about the necessity for it,"" said Dr. Darrell Triulzi, a University of Pittsburgh transfusion medicine specialist.
The new study is the first large one to evaluate whether the testing made sense, he added.
The researchers looked at the results of screenings done by the American Red Cross, which collects 42 percent of the U.S. blood supply. They focused on donations from the Lower 48 states from June 2016 to September 2017.
Health officials say there have been four transfusion-related Zika cases reported in Brazil, but none in the United States.
In a related journal article, four Johns Hopkins University medical experts questioned whether it makes sense to maintain intensive testing for Zika.
The FDA has never before revoked a recommendation to test blood donations for a potentially harmful germ, and it's unlikely the agency would do that now, experts said.
But the agency could call for a less intensive screening called mini-pool testing. Rather than running a test on each separate donor, mini-pool testing involves mixing samples from 16 donors and testing the batch. When a batch tests positive, individual testing is done to find the tainted donation.
That's what's done with West Nile virus and other germs, experts said.
Mini-pool testing would cut the cost of Zika testing in half, said Susan Stramer, one of the study's authors and vice president of scientific affairs at the Red Cross.
Details from the study were presented to an FDA advisory committee in December. The committee voted against the idea of eliminating Zika testing of blood donations but endorsed mini-pool testing. The FDA has not yet acted on the panel's recommendation.

9626,CNN,"How to live it up in retirement, without burning through savings","My husband and I are planning to retire this year and want to enjoy retirement. We do not want to skimp on simple pleasures and die with lots of money in the bank. But we also don't want to run through our savings too soon. So how do we calculate withdrawals from our nest egg to spend as much as possible of our assets before we shuffle off this mortal coil? --E.S.
You'd think that having a great time spending all the money you've socked away for retirement would be a cinch. After all, the whole point of saving and investing in 401(k)s and other retirement accounts during your working years is to enjoy yourself after calling it a career.
But a number of recent studies suggest that many people may have a harder time spending down their retirement nest egg than you may think. For example, a 2016 study of retiree spending habits found that with the exception of those of modest means, retirees on average were spending less then they could actually afford, while wealthy retirees were spending less than half of the amount their savings and other resources would support.
And last year when researchers for the BlackRock Retirement Institute examined the spending and savings of thousands of people who retired in the early 1990s, they not only found that most of these retirees still had at least half of their retirement savings remaining after nearly 20 years of retirement, but that many actually had a larger nest egg than when when they entered retirement.
There can be several explanations for this seeming reluctance to spend down one's savings. Some retirees, especially those with considerable amounts of money tucked away, may plan on leaving a portion of their savings to their heirs or charity. Many are no doubt being cautious because they fear they'll incur large medical expenses late in life or that they'll run through their savings too early and have to scrimp in their dotage.
But others may simply have trouble making the transition from saving to spending. After years of thrift, they have developed an extreme reluctance to spend, or a condition I've dubbed ""Spendaphobia,"" which makes it difficult for them to loosen their purse strings and enjoy the benefits of all those years of saving for the future.
Related: A 3-step plan to a secure retirement
Which brings us back to your question: How do you improve your chances of spending so that you enjoy your time in retirement as much as you can, yet not overdo it and jeopardize your financial security or even outlive your nest egg?
The best way to start is by doing a full-fledged retirement budget, as this will give you a sense of what your actual expenses will be after you retire and how much you'll have to spend to maintain your current standard of living. You can create such a budget by going to an online tool like BlackRock's Retirement Expense Worksheet, which allows you to enter upwards of 50 expense items in eight broad categories that cover both essential (housing, health care, food, transportation, etc.) and discretionary (entertainment, charitable contributions, whatever) spending.
You won't be able to predict your spending with 100% certainty (although, if you do some lifestyle planning, or giving serious thought to how you'll live after you retire, you'll come away with a more accurate estimate than if you just wing it). But the idea is to do the best you can and then refine your estimates as you near and enter retirement.
Once you have a decent idea of how much you'll need to spend (at least initially), you'll want to gauge whether Social Security, any pensions and draws from your savings will be able to support that level of spending. You can make that assessment by going to a good retirement calculator like T. Rowe Price's Retirement Income Calculator.
You enter such information as your age, current income, the current value of your savings and the amount you expect to receive from any pensions and Social Security (the tool will automatically estimate your payment or you can go to Social Security's Retirement Estimator). The tool will then estimate the chances that your savings will be able to generate enough income (after taking Social Security and any pensions into account) for the rest of your life to support your desired level of spending. (If you plan to leave assets to charity or heirs, you can earmark that amount and exclude it from the analysis.)
To feel reasonably secure that you won't outlive your savings, I'd think you'd want to see an estimate of 80% or better that your savings will last a lifetime. Generally, if you start with an initial annual withdrawal equal to 3% to 4% of savings -- or $30,000 to $40,000 for a $1 million nest egg -- and then adjust that amount each year for inflation to maintain purchasing power, you'll likely come in close to that 80%-or-better target.
If the tool estimates a success rate much lower than that, however, you may want to revise your planned spending down a bit. Conversely, if the chances of your savings supporting you the rest of your life come in a lot higher than 80%, you might consider spending some more.
But whatever level of spending you start with, you need to be ready to adjust it up or down as conditions change. For example, if your nest egg's value declines sharply because the financial markets take a big hit as they did during the 2008 financial crisis, you may want to forgo an inflation increase or even scale back your planned withdrawal to avoid running through your assets too soon.
If, on the other hand, your savings balance begins to balloon because the markets are churning out well-above-average gains, as has been the case in recent years, you may want to splurge a bit and boost your spending so that you don't end up with a big pile of assets late in retirement along with regrets you didn't spend more early in retirement when you might have enjoyed yourself more.
By making such adjustments and periodically re-visiting a retirement income calculator throughout retirement with updated information about your savings balance and planned withdrawals, you should be able to get a sense of whether you're spending down your nest egg at a ""Goldilocks"" pace, i.e., not too fast but not too slow.
Related: How much income will you actually need in retirement?
One more thing you can do to boost your odds of having a happier and more rewarding retirement is spend in ways that have been shown to generate more satisfaction and happiness for retirees.
When Michael Finke of The American College and other researchers looked last year at the spending habits of some 1,500 retirees, they concluded that only one type of spending predicted retirement satisfaction -- namely, the money they spend on leisure activities, including travel, entertainment, dining out and hobbies. Finke believes such spending tends to boost happiness because it keeps us more active and socially engaged. (For what it's worth, Merrill Lynch research has found that seniors who give back in some way, whether volunteering or contributing to organizations whose values and aims they support, were more likely to say they were happier and had a strong sense of purpose in life.)
Neither I nor anyone else can offer a spending formula or specific withdrawal percentage that will guarantee you won't run through your savings while you're still alive and kicking while ensuring that you won't leave behind any more money than you wish. There are too many uncertainties -- how the markets will perform, how long you'll live, how your spending needs might change, etc. -- for such guarantees.
But if you start with a level of spending that's reasonable, monitor and adjust your outlays as you go along and to the extent possible direct your spending to areas that have the highest happiness payoff so to speak, you should be able to enjoy retirement and get the most out of money you've managed to save.",UNDEFINED

CLOSE Rudy Giuliani has UNLOADED on potential 2020 hopeful Joe Biden! Rob Smith has all the details. Buzz60
With more than two years to go before the next presidential election, former Vice President Joe Biden is the early favorite to represent the Democrats and try to unseat President Donald Trump in the 2020 election, according to a new poll.
Biden was the choice of 32 percent of Democrats in a Harvard CAPS/Harris June poll that was obtained by The Hill. The party's 2016 standard bearer, Hillary Clinton, came in second with 18 percent and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was third with 16 percent.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was fourth with 10 percent of the vote.
Biden, who would be 77 on Election Day in 2020, has been one of Trump's most vocal critics since the 2016 campaign. On at least two occasions, the former vice president has indicated that he wishes he was back in high school so that he could physically confront the president over his comments about women. (Trump responded in a tweet that Biden would ""go down fast and hard, crying all the way"" if they fought.)
Although Clinton has given no indication she intends to run again, both Biden and Sanders have not ruled out a run in 2020.

Biden considered running in 2016, but he decided against it because it did not think he could defeat Clinton and because he was still grieving after he lost his son Beau Biden to brain cancer.
Among other Democrats included in the poll, The Hill reported that Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., got 6 percent, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg got 3 percent, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., got 2 percent, while Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo each got 1 percent.
Another 12 percent of respondents said their preferred candidate was not among the names listed.

44373,CBS News,Could this experimental drug stop the flu in 24 hours?,"A Japanese drug company is offering up a big claim: Shionogi & Co. says it has an experimental pill that can kill the flu virus within a single day, according to news reports.
In a clinical trial, a single dose of the drug made by the pharmaceutical company eliminated the virus from people's bodies in a median time of 24 hours, The Wall Street Journal reported. Both Japanese and American flu patients were included in the trial.
The experimental drug worked three times faster than another antiviral drug, Tamiflu, the company told the Journal.
The drug uses a different approach to fight the flu than other medications. The flu virus spreads through the body by invading cells. Once inside a cell, it hijacks the cell's machinery, forcing the cell to make copies of the virus. Then, the newly copied viruses break out of the cell, spreading to other cells nearby and repeating the process.
Existing drugs, including Tamiflu, work to block these viral copies from escaping the cell, the Journal reported. The experimental drug, however, kicks into action earlier, working to block the virus from hijacking cells in the first place, the Journal said.
Japanese drug regulators could approve the drug for use in Japan by early March, the Journal reported. The drugmaker plans to apply for approval in the U.S. this summer; however, the drug likely wouldn't be available here until next year.

31316,BBC,How to make sense of those pesky Brexit forecasts,"Image copyright AFP
The Bank of England, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Monetary Fund, the London School of Economics, the US government funded Rand Corporation and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.
Each of these august organisations has investigated the possible economic impact of the decision to leave the European Union and has come to the conclusion that the impact will be - and in part already is - negative.
The UK economy would be likely to perform better over the next 15 years if the decision on Brexit had not been taken, the economic modelling suggests.
No scenario - a relationship with the EU based on World Trade Organisation rules, a comprehensive free trade agreement or continued, associate, membership of the single market - would be better for the economy than the status quo.
Leaked Brexit paper suggests economic hit
The government's analysis, leaked this morning, suggests similar.
And it is in fact pretty close to the Treasury analysis of the possible economic impact of Britain leaving the European Union which was published before the referendum in April 2016.
Forecasts should not be used as a prediction of a precise end point.
No one should suggest - politician or otherwise - that any model reveals what will definitely happen.
Governments and central banks can change policies, for example, to try and prevent forecasted outcomes.
Image copyright Getty Images
And Brexit is not the only factor governing our economic future.
Rather, they are the central finding of a range of scenarios allowing a sensible judgement to be made about a future direction of travel.
Imagine you had two dice, and you threw them onto a table.
A sensible forecast about the most likely range of numbers the two dice would add up to would be 6, 7 or 8.
Those are the numbers with the highest probability of appearing - throwing a 7 (which could come via 6+1; 1 +6; 5+2; 2+5; 3+4; 4+3) is much more likely than throwing a 12 (6+6).
If you then throw an 11 (5+6 or 6+5), the forecast would still be reasonable - even though one of the outlying scenarios had come to pass.
But it is also true that we haven't been throwing a series of predictable sevens.
As ever with strong forecasts, many of the central scenarios have come to pass.
And some haven't.
The forecast for the UK economy following the Brexit vote suggested that growth would slow, the value of sterling would fall and inflation (prices) would rise, leading to a fresh incomes squeeze.
Those forecasts have been borne out by events.
The rest of Europe has been growing more strongly than the UK.
Of course, not all that is down to Brexit.
But it is reasonable to assume some of it is, given that the UK was top of the growth charts two years ago and the referendum is the one, substantive change.
And, as Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, said in his interview on the Today programme last week that means tens of billions of pounds of economic activity isn't happening that could have been expected to be happening if Britain had decided not to leave the EU.
Other parts of the forecasts have not come to pass.
Unemployment has not soared.
Consumer confidence has not collapsed.
And there has been little sign of a recession.
Image copyright Reuters
Why? Because forecasts are not built to include all the ""dynamic effects"" of changing circumstances.
After the referendum, the Bank of England cut interest rates and increased its levels of asset purchases (quantitative easing).
This monetary stimulus acted as a shock absorber.
The fall in the value of sterling was also an economic stimulus, making our exports more competitive.
And the government also loosened the public spending purse strings in the Autumn Statement that followed the referendum, providing a fiscal boost.
The fact is, economic forecasts are negative because of the trade impact of leaving a single market and customs union with our biggest trading partner.
Better than expected
But, other effects can mitigate those downside risks - such as, over time, signing trade deals with other countries.
The UK economy has performed better than some predicted.
Better global growth has helped, alongside that monetary and fiscal stimulus.
And, of course, we haven't left the EU yet.
Forecasts are just that - a range of the likely scenarios given the wide range of data and statistical analysis now possible about economic relations around the world and their effects on economic performance.
But they are not set in stone.
And that is where politicians come in: they can change the forecasting weather.",UNDEFINED
114881,NPR,"CIA Director Pompeo Met With Kim Jong Un: 'Good Relationship' Formed, Trump Says","CIA Director Pompeo Met With Kim Jong Un: 'Good Relationship' Formed, Trump Says
Enlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/AP
CIA Director Mike Pompeo made a secret visit to North Korea earlier this month and met with leader Kim Jong Un — a meeting that ""went very smoothly,"" President Trump said on Wednesday.
Saying that ""a good relationship was formed,"" Trump added that the meeting was part of the process of working out the details of a possible Trump-Kim summit.
In a tweet, the president added, ""Denuclearization will be a great thing for World, but also for North Korea!""
Trump confirmed some of the details that had been reported by multiple outlets that quoted unnamed White House officials speaking about Pompeo's trip.
The president, speaking at a joint news conference Tuesday with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe from the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, said the U.S. and North Korea have had direct talks ""at very high levels.""
Trump said that he expected to sit down with the North Korean leader in early June, if not earlier, and that the White House was considering five possible sites for such a meeting.
The Washington Post, which first reported the Pompeo visit, notes, ""Pompeo has taken the lead on the administration's negotiations with Pyongyang. His meeting with Kim marks the highest-level contact between the two countries since 2000, when then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Kim Jong Il, the current leader's late father, to discuss strategic issues. Then-Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. visited the country in 2014 to secure the release of two American captives and met with a lower-level intelligence official.""
Pompeo, who is awaiting confirmation to succeed Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, ""has been dealing with North Korean representatives through a channel that runs between the C.I.A. and its North Korean counterpart, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, according to other officials. And he has been in close touch with the director of South Korea's National Intelligence Service, Suh Hoon, who American officials said brokered Mr. Kim's invitation to Mr. Trump,"" The New York Times reports.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday that the two leaders have not yet spoken directly.
If Trump and Kim do meet, it would be the first direct talks between a U.S. and North Korean leader. The U.S. played a key role in the bitterly fought Korea War that ended in an armistice – not a peace treaty – in 1953. North and South Korea have technically been in a state of war ever since.
Given his harsh words for Pyongyang and its leader, Kim, since taking office — including his threat to respond to Pyongyang's missile tests with ""fire and fury"" — Trump signaled a more conciliatory note in the news conference with Abe.
""I really believe there's a lot of good will. They do respect us. We are respectful of them,"" the president said.
""They do have my blessing to discuss the end of the war,"" he said. ""Subject to a deal, they have my blessing.""
For his part, Abe, whose country has been a frequent target of North Korea's ire and a would-be target of its ballistic missiles, praised Trump for his ""unwavering determination in addressing the challenge of North Korea.""",LEFT

(Photo: Al-Furqan Media/AFP/Getty Images)
At least five senior Islamic State officials have been captured in a three-month operation by Iraqi and American intelligence that involved phone apps and the breaking of secret bank accounts and communication codes, according to news reports.
The captures were announced Wednesday on Iraqi state TV, which broadcast images of four of the detainees wearing yellow prisoner jumpsuits.
President Trump, in a tweet on Thursday, said only that ""Five Most Wanted leaders of ISIS just captured.""
The New York Times, citing two unidentified Iraqi officials, reported that the five included Ismail Alwaan al-Ithawi, who is described as a top aide to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the secretive leader of the Islamic State's so-called caliphate that he declared in 2014. He remains on the run.
The report said Ithawi had been tracked by Iraqi intelligence to the Turkish city of Sakarya, where he was living under his brother's identity. Turkish security forces arrested him on Feb. 15 and extradited him to Iraq, the Times reported.
After weeks of interrogation, Ithawi was persuaded to contact several of his ISIS colleagues and lure them across the border, the newspaper reported.
Iraqi agents used the Telegram messaging app on Ithawi's mobile phone to draw the others into the trap, Iraqi security adviser Hisham al-Hashimi told Reuters on Thursday.
Also arrested were Saddam al-Jammel, a Syrian who had governed the Islamic State territory around Deir al-Zour, and Abu Abdel al-Haq, an Iraqi who had been the head of internal security for ISIS, according to the Times.
Syrian Mohamed al-Qadeer, and two Iraqis, Omar al-Karbouli and Essam al-Zawbai, were also captured.

Following Ithawi’s capture, Iraqi and American intelligence agents were able to uncover bank accounts used by the group and secret communication codes he used, Hashimi said.
“The noose is tightening around him,” Hashimi said, referring to Baghdadi.
Hashimi said the operation was carried out in cooperation with U.S. forces, part of an American-led coalition fighting against Islamic State on both sides of the Iraqi-Syrian border.

On Norfolk Street, in Liverpool’s trendy Baltic Quarter, stands the six-storey concrete carcass of what was supposed to be Baltic House, launched in 2015 as a “groundbreaking” development of student flats and creative live-work units. It was the first phase of the Gallery+ project, an “elegant, cool, urban and edgy” mixed-use scheme, centred around a gallery of Banksy murals that had been ripped from nearby walls. It was one of many such glamorous projects devised by property company North Point Global, marketed with great fanfare in China and Hong Kong and sold off-plan to investors with the lucrative promise of high yields, before mysteriously grinding to a halt. Three years on, the company has pulled out of its planned £360m suite of projects across the city and stopped picking up the phone, leaving buyers to believe they are the victims of a ruthless scam, fiercely denied by the developers in question.
How Baltic House was supposed to look – and how it looked last week
“We all thought the UK was a safe place to invest,” says Florence Leung, a retired Hong Kong accountant who put a substantial chunk of her life savings into a unit in Baltic House, and has since had to return to work to make ends meet.
Along with many others, Leung said she was wooed at a lavish promotional roadshow at a hotel in Hong Kong and convinced to pay 80% of the price of a student flat upfront, with promises of 6% interest on her deposit, followed by guaranteed 9% returns in rental income once the project was finished. Months later, buyers received requests for further funds to complete the building, before North Point Global announced it was stopping work all together – and couldn’t refund the buyers’ deposits.

Groups of frustrated buyers have since raised what they believe to be serious conflicts of interest, with the same individuals simultaneously acting as directors of the development companies, contractors and independent surveyors – claims that have been denied by all parties involved.
Q&A What is buyer-funded development? Show Hide It is an increasingly popular model of financing property developments by using deposits from many individual buyers. Apartments are sold off-plan to buyers, often overseas, who pay substantial deposits of up to 80% upfront. Their money is used to fund the entire project, from marketing fees to construction costs. The model has become more commonplace since the financial crisis of 2008, after which it became harder for developers to borrow from banks and institutional lenders to fund their schemes. It is seen as a risky form of investment as construction often begins without the commitment of funding to complete it, and there is no safety net if costs balloon beyond projections and funds run out. The Solicitors’ Regulation Authority has warned of ""substantial risks” of misappropriation of money the developer failing to deliver on the proposal or becoming insolvent, with buyers “unwittingly financing high risk or fraudulent property development.”
“The UK government must take action,” says James To Kun-sun, a member of Hong Kong’s legislative council, who has been inundated with complaints from hundreds of local buyers claiming they have been victims of UK property fraud. He estimates more than 700 buyers have lost an average of HK$500,000 (£45,000) in Hong Kong alone, with many more across Asia and beyond. “People here have a sentimental link with the UK, as a place with a responsible government, democracy and the rule of law, so it is shocking that this can be allowed to happen. It seems the development industry isn’t properly regulated and politicians are willing to endorse any kind of project. In Hong Kong we reformed our system 40 years ago, so buyers’ deposits cannot be released to the developer until a project is completed.”
Buyers were aghast to discover that most of their money had been spent before a single brick had been laid
In 2015, then-chancellor George Osborne led a UK government trade mission to China, accompanied by the Mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, to trumpet the “golden era” of Sino-British relations. They were there to sell the Northern Pitchbook, a £24bn catalogue of investment opportunities, one highlight of which was Liverpool’s New Chinatown. Devised by North Point Global, this flagship £200m development of 800 luxury flats was to stand in the shadow of the Anglican Cathedral, as a dramatic cluster of angular towers rising above a Chinese bazaar.
“We have an idea, because of Liverpool’s links to China, of a new Chinese-themed attraction to bring it all to life,” Osborne told the Liverpool Echo in September 2015, speaking on the phone from Chengdu. “I’ve just been talking to one of the Chinese investors at the Liverpool stand,” he continued. “And Joe and I were going at it as a tag team, to try and persuade him to put his money into Liverpool.”
‘Joe and I were going at it as a tag team’ ... George Osborne, then chancellor, pictured with the mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, describes how the pair promoted some of the failed property schemes in Asia
Little did Osborne know that the project he was so eagerly promoting would end in limbo, with investors out of pocket, contractors in administration and the council taking the developer to court.
“Liverpool’s reputation has been trashed,” says Cllr Richard Kemp, leader of the city’s Liberal Democrats. “Buyers were led to believe these projects were backed by the council, because of the mayor and his deputy’s promotional visits, but they were nothing of the sort. The council flogged off the land without doing any due diligence on who they were selling it to, and now we won’t see the money.”
Deputy mayor Gary Millar, meanwhile, has travelled to China and Hong Kong at least seven times in the last five years to promote investment opportunities in Liverpool, and has been pictured toasting buyers at North Point Global promotional events. He denies any wrongdoing. “I completely understand the investors’ frustration with their stalled schemes,” he told the Liverpool Echo. “However, I know I did nothing wrong.”
How they did it
This risky form of buyer-funded development (sometimes known as investor-led fractional sales) has mushroomed since the 2008 financial crisis, after which banks grew reluctant to finance property. Instead, many developers have turned to individual buyers to fund the entire cost of development, using their hefty deposits to pay for everything from marketing to professional fees and construction costs. Whereas a conventional model of off-plan development sees the buyers’ deposits (typically 10% of purchase price) held in a secure escrow account, and only released on completion of the building, this alternative form of buyer-funded development sees investors paying up to 80%, which can be spent on all manner of costs and fees before construction has even begun.
A close network of individuals crop up in different companies, ​​often registered to the same address
“It’s an incredibly risky form of investment,” says Clifford Tibber, expert in property law at Anthony Gold solicitors. “Very often the developments are not legitimate ... Developers are bypassing banks and targeting unsophisticated individuals who are willing to throw their life savings at a chance of making big profits.”
Last year the Solicitors Regulation Authority warned solicitors not to get involved in such projects: “our view is that they involve consumer clients unwittingly financing high risk or fraudulent property development”. The SRA notice describes a process whereby “investors provide money for a ‘deposit’ which is released to the seller upon some (often spurious) condition. [...] This carries substantial risks such as the money being misappropriated, the seller failing to complete the scheme or the seller becoming insolvent.”
In the last year, the SRA has taken action against eight law firms involved in such schemes and investigated cases with reported investor losses of over £100m. The northwest regional organised crime unit, Titan, is now considering a number of cases, after hundreds of buyers have come forward with similar allegations.
The Angelgate development in Manchester. More than £30m was taken in buyers deposits before the firm went into administration
One of the most prominent is the Angelgate development in Manchester, a scheme of 344 luxury apartments launched in 2015 by Pinnacle, a company linked to former convicted conman Tony Freeman, whose home was reportedly raided in July 2017 over a £3m tax fraud probe. Pinnacle said the raid was a personal investigation and nothing to do with the company, and said Freeman works for it as a consultant but denied that he has any involvement in the firm’s ownership. Once again, the Angelgate units were sold off-plan to investors, many in Asia, with more than £30m taken in buyers’ deposits before the firm was forced into administration last year.
Buyers were aghast to discover that most of their money had already been spent before a single brick had been laid. As the administrator’s report states: “It is not clear how on any basis [Pinnacle] could justify spending 40% of the funds received from buyers on sales and marketing commissions,” adding that an additional £5.1m had been paid to the contractor, despite no construction work having begun. A spokesperson for Pinnacle insists that “foundational work” had been conducted, and blames the situation on the collapse of the contractor, PHD1, which had “significantly under-valued the build”.
‘Outrageous’
Surveyor David Choules, whose company Inca Management was responsible for certifying the stages of work, agrees that the developer’s fees were “considerable and outrageous”. “They changed their financial appraisal a couple of times during the project and decided to take out more fees,” he says. “But, as the certifier, it wasn’t our position to challenge that. We can have an opinion, but it’s down to the lawyers to advise.”

Solicitor David Roberts, the lawyer who managed the buyers’ accounts for a number of these failed schemes, says: “Our role was to administer the funds in accordance with the sales agreement, which the buyers had voluntarily entered into. Once Inca certified the expenditure, the invoices became payable and we released the money to the developer.”
Pinnacle said it was not true that commissions or fees had been used to extract money from Angelgate, adding that “absolutely no profits have been recognised from this development”. The spokesperson added that Pinnacle had never been contacted by police, and said, “If they ever were, they would fully cooperate.”
Concerned buyers have highlighted a series of connections between Pinnacle and North Point Global, and a recurring pattern of events – chief among which was their deposits being released to the developer without much sign of work taking place.
They point to a close network of individuals who crop up in different roles at a variety of companies, often all registered to the same address – the 2nd floor of the Edward Pavilion in Liverpool’s Albert Dock.
It seems … politicians are willing to endorse any kind of project James To Kun-sun
North Point Global was founded here in 2015 by Peter McInnes, who had worked with Tony Freeman to build a series of earlier Pinnacle schemes in Chester, Canterbury and Liverpool with his construction firm PHD1, before the two parted ways. McInnes – who has lived in Dubai for the last decade – was never a director or shareholder of either North Point Global or PHD1, but was described as chairman of both firms in their press releases. He has since denied chairing either company. He quickly established a buzz around the North Point brand, launching projects from North Point Pall Mall in Liverpool, with “sky gardens” and “rooftop paddle courts”, to the Element in Old Trafford, Manchester.
“He’s a very dynamic personality,” says property consultant Samuel Beilin, an associate of the company, who was also a director of PHD1, and who was previously declared bankrupt in 2010, with debts of around £1m. He now represents McInnes and the North Point Global Group. “Peter McInnes is a great promoter and he was able to convince the council that he could deliver high-quality, well-designed, mixed-use schemes on an industrial scale.” Liverpool council awarded the New Chinatown site to North Point Global in 2015, over another more established developer, X1 Ltd, despite the company having only been incorporated two months earlier.
North Point Pall Mall pictured last week
David Choules was another founding director of North Point Global, and later chaired the company, while at the same time his firm Inca was employed to certify expenditure on the firm’s developments. Buyers have pointed to what they believe to be a clear conflict of interest, with the same person certifying work for funds to be released, while also standing to receive those funds.
Choules denies any conflict and says he has been open and transparent at all times and that his colleague handled the day-to-day certification of works. He says he resigned from North Point Global in July 2016 “to avoid any perceived conflicts.”
Jailed gangsters
Off-plan sales boomed and it all seemed to be going well, until Peter McInnes made headlines in March 2017, when his name was referred to in a court case about a notorious pair of jailed Liverpool gangsters, Stephen and Peter Clarke, in a hearing at Preston Crown Court. “He fronts companies, runs them until accounts are due and then scraps them and then moves on,” said DC Duncan Watson, financial investigator for the Cumbria constabulary, said of McInnes, adding that he didn’t know how someone like this “could be taken on by a council”.
McInnes has fiercely denied the claims, saying he had not been represented in court to respond to the allegations, and that he had never been arrested, questioned or charged over money laundering in relation to any matter. Beilin bats away the accusations of criminal behaviour, but says such associations shouldn’t be surprising: “Liverpool is a small place. Behind every developer there’s a former relationship, friendship or businesses agreement with someone who isn’t totally savoury.”
I do feel sorry for them. But if a Romanian property roadshow came to the UK, I would not buy an off-plan apartment Sam Beilin of North Point Global
“The council is often attracted to partners who they think will be beneficial to them in the short term,” he adds, “but who turn out not to do them any favours in the long run. They really thought McInnes could deliver, but perhaps they didn’t do as much due diligence as they could have done in investigating the financial capacity of North Point Global.”
Liverpool City Council insists that proper due diligence was undertaken and that the developer was chosen on the basis of the ability to conclude a commercial deal in a timely fashion, the quality of the scheme submitted, and evidence of a wider strategy for the regeneration of the Chinatown area.
Once buyers’ deposits had been secured, the New Chinatown project quickly began to unravel. As with Angelgate, it turned out that PHD1 had grossly undervalued the construction costs of the ambitious designs. The firm went into administration in April 2016, with debts of over £14m, including £7.8m owed to subcontractors. The building work on North Point Global’s sites was then taken on by the BILT group, which had been established just two months earlier. All the BILT firms went into liquidation one year after they were formed, with combined debts of £1.8m. Subcontractors told Construction Enquirer that they were not paid for their work.
In July 2017, North Point Global announced it was halting work entirely and would seek to dispose of all of its sites, blaming the situation on adverse media coverage and the behaviour of the Liverpool City Council, which had publicly stated that it had reported the developer to the National Crime Agency. A spokesman for North Point Global said in a statement: “It would be wholly unrealistic to return to site on any of their projects as they consider that the brand has become tainted and damaged beyond salvage.” They insist that the company has never been contacted by the NCA or any other law enforcement agency.
Most of its building sites have stood untouched for 18 months, the concrete frames and exposed foundations standing as rotting monuments to the developer’s greed, investors’ naivety and mayoral hubris. The Banksy murals, including the 12-metre high Liverpool Rat and Love Plane, which were promised to return to public display, have been sold for £3.2m to an anonymous buyer in Qatar.
After months of uncertainty, it was announced this week that the New Chinatown site will be taken on by a new developer, which plans to resume work by the summer. “Our funding model will also be significantly different,” says Neal Hunter of Great George Street Developments. “We are engaging with major institutional investors to fund the scheme, rather than being reliant on multiple small investors.”
The other sites will be sold, with “whatever money left divided back pro-rata to the buyers,” says Beilin. Given the number of creditors queuing up, to whom North Point Global owes almost £4.2m, the chances of investors seeing their money back are slim.
“I do feel sorry for them,” Beilin adds. “Whenever there’s a failure, there’s always a tendency to look for someone to take responsibility. But, when the buyers signed those sales contracts, I don’t think they actually understood what they were signing.”
He adds bluntly: “If a Romanian property roadshow came to the UK, I would not buy a fractional off-plan apartment and if I did I would not pay more than a nominal deposit until it was built.”
The victims
Sitting in a cafe in Hong Kong’s Causeway Bay, one Baltic House buyer recalls the extravagant events where North Point Global’s projects were unveiled with dazzling models and presentations about Liverpool’s booming economy.
“We were wined and dined, and taken for celebratory banquets with Peter McInnes and Gary Millar,” says Mr Cheung. “It was presented as a council-backed project, and we were told it was a low-risk investment.” At the first promotional roadshow, Cheung was convinced to buy three units in Baltic House, followed by another three a month later. One year on, he was persuaded by promises of ever-higher yields to buy six more. “They even funded travel costs for us to come and see the site in Liverpool, so it all felt legitimate,” he says.
Promises v reality: how the schemes were sold – and what they look like now Read more
One Hong Kong sales agent who was involved in promoting New Chinatown, before his company withdrew from the deal over unpaid fees, recalls the lavish roadshows. “Every few months they would turn up in Hong Kong and have a big yeehaw blow-out to say thank you to the buyers,” he says.
Across town, another buyer tells how he remortgaged his home in Hong Kong in order to invest in three units in New Chinatown, Baltic House and the Element in Manchester, paying 80% upfront. “Gary Millar told us these were big, important projects for the whole country, that’s why I was convinced to go for it,” says Mr Chan, who had retired but is now looking for work again. “I loved the British system, but this experience has changed my opinion.”

156334,Reuters,Ethnic Serb fugitive is nominated as court judge by Kosovo,"PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo’s parliament is facing criticism from the opposition and watchdog organizations for nominating as a judge a Serb who fled to Kosovo to avoid being jailed for corruption.
Parliament voted last week to appoint Radomir Laban to serve as a judge of the Constitutional Court representing the Kosovo Serb minority. President Hashim Thaci has two weeks in which to approve or reject the nomination.
According to Serbia’s court records, Laban, who has a law degree, was sentenced in 2011 to six years in jail for corruption as an official of the Serbian Customs. He had already served half his sentence in pre-trial detention between 2006 and 2009.
After the trial, Laban was provisionally released until he was called to serve the rest of his sentence, but instead he fled to neighboring Kosovo. Last year, a Serbian court in the town of Kraljevo issued an arrest warrant demanding he be handed back to Serbia.
Laban was nominated for the post by the Serb List party that represents the around five percent of Kosovo Serbs and which is controlled by Belgrade. Serbia refuses to recognize Pristina’s 2008 declaration of independence.
“Unfortunately, Kosovo has become a country which rehabilitates criminals into the most important constitutional institutions,” Albulena Haxhiu of the opposition party Vetevendosje wrote on Facebook.
“This person should not be appointed a judge of the constitutional court.”
“Any judge of this court should have no criminal past and no one should be appointed if he or she can be blackmailed,” Ehat Miftaraj from the Kosovo Institute for Justice, a non-governmental organization, told Reuters.
“The president should review this decision and act based on the law.”
The background of the candidates for judges is checked by Kosovo law enforcement agencies, but Laban’s case will be difficult to solve because of Serbia’s refusal to cooperate with authorities in Pristina.
Law enforcement agencies of Kosovo and Serbia communicate only through European Union bodies in both countries.
EULEX, a EU law and police mission in Kosovo, said it did not have the competency to extradite Laban under its current mandate and had told this to the Kraljevo court in Serbia.",CENTER
168741,Politico,Review of Cohen’s records finds a fraction fall under attorney-client privilege,"Michael Cohen is under scrutiny for possible fraud and his role in arranging a $130,000 payment to an adult-film actress in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair with Donald Trump. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images Review of Cohen’s records finds a fraction fall under attorney-client privilege
A former federal judge tasked with sifting through records seized from President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer is recommending federal prosecutors can see all but a fraction of the items.
In a two-page status report submitted Monday, court-appointed special master Barbara Jones said she found just 14 out of 639 items — containing 12,543 pages of “hard copy materials” taken from Michael Cohen’s home, office and hotel room — should be held back from federal prosecutors because of attorney-client privilege.
Story Continued Below
Separately, Jones ruled that 148 out of 291,770 total items on two phones and an iPad taken from Cohen by the FBI fell into privileged or partially privileged categories. Another seven items, Jones added, were deemed “Highly Personal.”
Jones’s report covers only a small part of the materials seized in April from Cohen, which includes more than a dozen mobile devices and 19 other digital-media devices. Todd Harrison, a lawyer for Cohen, told the court last week that his firm had received about 3.7 million files, with about 1.3 million already turned over to Jones for her review.
In a report filed last week, Jones said the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York had received its first batch of the information, including nearly 300,000 “items.” Her report did not specify what an “item” was – though it’s likely to include a photo, video file or email message.
Jones, a former U.S. District Court judge in Manhattan, was appointed in April to lead the review process of the FBI-seized materials after lawyers for Cohen, Trump and the Trump Organization demanded the court ensure any legally privileged attorney-client communications didn’t end up in the hands of federal prosecutors who are examining Cohen’s business affairs.
That investigation, being led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York, encompasses potential fraud charges against Cohen, as well as examining his role in arranging a $130,000 payment before the 2016 presidential election to the adult-film actress Stormy Daniels to get her to remain silent about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.",UNDEFINED
60620,CNN,Jewish center bomb threat suspect charged with hate crimes,"(CNN) The Justice Department added new hate crime charges Wednesday against a 19-year-old man accused of making a weeks-long series of threatening phone calls that rattled Jewish community centers and prompted school evacuations across the country last year.
Michael Ron David Kadar, a dual American-Israeli citizen, was initially charged last spring in Florida and Georgia with making threatening calls, cyberstalking and providing police with false information about a hostage situation at a private home.
Nearly 10 months later, a federal grand jury returned a fresh indictment Wednesday in Florida, charging Kadar with a federal hate crime for making the bomb threats against Jewish community centers throughout the state.
Prosecutors also levied new charges against Kadar on Wednesday in Washington, DC, alleging he had called in a bomb threat against the Anti-Defamation League and sent a threatening email to the Israeli Embassy in March 2017.
While no explosives were ever recovered, the federal indictments say the calls and emails prompted evacuations or lockdowns of the targeted facilities.

154262,The Guardian,How we're helping vulnerable women to keep their children out of care,"In social care we know that women who have a child taken into care often face this predicament more than once, sometimes three or four times. We also know that on many occasions, these women were in care themselves as children. Approximately one in four birth mothers in family court proceedings will reappear with a subsequent child, and recent research suggests 58% of these mothers will have experienced sexual abuse.
​The young mothers trapped in a cycle of having babies removed Read more
But we also know that nearly half of women in this predicament can, at a later stage, care for a child appropriately. Improvements in their mental health and growing maturity can enable them to become successful carers. So could the whole painful process of having a child removed have been avoided?
As our family courts have contracted through the age of austerity and the number of care proceedings has increased by 27% over the last four years, the system is failing to cope.
The arithmetic is scary too. The average cost of a looked-after child in my borough is £57,000 per year. If the average length of care is 3.6 years, this means that the cost of each child in care is more than £200,000. Where children are long-term fostered or adopted, the costs are more than triple that figure.
Across the country, grant-funded schemes are trying to break this cycle; so-called Pause programmes support women who may become recurrent mothers, or care leavers who become pregnant and may be in danger of losing their child. Some schemes encourage women to take long lasting contraception. I have mixed feelings about the use of long lasting contraception contraception with women in these circumstances.
We teach techniques to support their parenting – and other approaches to deal with mental health issues and drug abuse
In Calderdale, we’re running a Positive Choices programme to support families. Unqualified family support workers, supervised by a social worker, are assigned to vulnerable women who are pregnant and at risk of having a child removed. They are shown techniques to support their parenting and other approaches to deal with mental health issues and drug abuse. Support is also given where there is or has been domestic violence in the household. After one year, we have helped nine women. Two cases have failed, with the children now in care, but seven have apparently been successful; the children are safe and not in need of removal to protect them.
Recently I had the opportunity to talk to some of the women involved in the programme to ask them what had worked for them.
The first (and possibly most remarkable) thing was that the young women were with their children at the meeting – and although they were engaged in a focused conversation with me, they gave their children almost continuous attention and eye contact. These mothers all came from challenging backgrounds: mental health problems, domestic violence and drug and alcohol abuse dominated their histories, but they were all prepared to describe their previous lifestyles – and they had clearly faced up to and understood their demons.
They all described being taught to look at the impact of their behaviour – their previous negative behaviour and their now positive behaviour – and the impact they had on their child’s development. They had ameliorated their behaviour and developed empathy with their child, understanding how their actions affected emotional wellbeing. For some, there was no way to mimic their own parents’ positive parenting traits as such influences had been absent from their childhoods.
Can new partnership keep vulnerable children out of care? Read more
I was humbled by their descriptions of the family support input from the programme: two pre-arranged visits each week plus one unannounced visit to their home, sometimes at the most unexpected times. The women seemed to accept this intrusion into their lives on the grounds that their children come first. Putting up with a little inconvenience to confirm the quality of their parenting seemed like a small price to pay.
A fair, firm and caring relationship between the woman and their key worker was also important. I heard of staff who were prepared to drop everything and call in when challenges arose, sometimes during evenings, weekends, annual leave and even during maternity leave. Visits, texts and calls were always possible and were massively appreciated.
The Positive Choices programme probably costs the public about £12,000 per case per year, so is proving to reduce costs when it is successful. And if we can manage to keep breaking the cycle of mothers having children taken into care, the human benefits will be immeasurable.

176701,CNN,Senate may deal Trump trade defeat on ZTE,"Washington (CNN) The Senate is on the verge of directly undercutting a key piece of President Donald Trump's trade negotiations with China, as a bipartisan group of lawmakers successfully pushed for the inclusion of a bill to undo a deal to save Chinese telecom ZTE.
Lawmakers are on track to attach an amendment to reimpose any penalty removed by the Trump administration on the firm -- which the president explicitly granted a reprieve from as part of his broader negotiations with Chinese President Xi Jinping -- to an annual defense policy bill that is expected to pass in the coming days.
""I think people are fed up with what ZTE did and they don't think we should just let them off hook, and that it does send a very bad signal to anybody else around the world who's thinking about violating sanctions of the United States,"" Sen. Chris Van Hollen, the Maryland Democrat who co-authored the amendment, told CNN of the bipartisan effort to move it forward.
The successful inclusion of an amendment to block the deal marks the latest twist in a fight that has roiled Capitol Hill and national security officials -- all as it became a cornerstone piece of Trump's China trade dealmaking strategy. For days, senators have scrambled to block the deal, all as the Trump administration has scrambled to undercut those efforts.
Still, the deal is not done yet. Should the Senate pass the underlying defense bill, it will still have to be reconciled with the House version, giving the Trump administration more time to try and block the effort.

131069,HuffPost,Mueller Threatened To Subpoena Trump If Lawyers Refused Sit-Down Interview,"Special counsel Robert Mueller warned President Donald Trump’s lawyers that he had the power to issue a subpoena if the White House refused a request for a sit-down interview with the president, The Washington Post reported Tuesday.
Mueller met with Trump’s attorneys in March to negotiate the terms of an interview, which he has sought for months as part of the inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The Post, citing four people familiar with the conversation, said the encounter quickly turned tense after the lawyers said Trump had no legal obligation to meet with the special counsel. Mueller then suggested he could issue a subpoena that would compel the president to appear before a grand jury.
“This isn’t some game,” John Dowd, Trump’s former lead attorney, replied. “You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States.”
Dowd later confirmed the encounter and his comments to Reuters.
The special counsel’s office has been negotiating the terms of any sit-down with Trump and his legal team amid the president’s own public assertions that he was “looking forward” to the interview. Dowd was among those urging Trump to reject the request, apparently over concerns that Trump has a tendency to go off-script, which could lead him to make false statements.
The New York Times on Monday published a list of questions Mueller hopes to ask Trump, a list that was compiled by Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow as part of those negotiations. Many of the open-ended queries focus on potential efforts to obstruct justice through the firings of FBI Director James Comey or attempts to fire the special counsel himself.
Dowd, upon hearing of Mueller’s line of inquiry, was further convinced that Trump should refuse an interview, the Times reported. He resigned from his role in March after the president appeared poised to reject his advice.
Dowd was replaced last month by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.
Trump on Tuesday condemned the release of the questions on Twitter and asserted that there were “no questions about collusion,” even though some do appear on the list.
“Oh, I see...you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice!” he wrote.",LEFT
75683,Politico,POLITICO-Harvard poll: Americans worry that government action on drug prices could backfire,"A leaked draft of Trump’s executive order on drug prices, obtained by POLITICO earlier this summer, contained few policies that would substantially reduce drug costs. | Stan Honda/AFP/Getty Images POLITICO-Harvard poll: Americans worry that government action on drug prices could backfire Members of both parties overwhelmingly want the government to do something about drug prices, but warnings of negative side effects resonate.
Americans want the government to crack down hard on drug pricing. That is, until they consider the potential side effects of using public sector muscle to rein in the pharmaceutical industry.
A new POLITICO-Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health poll finds that Republicans and Democrats alike overwhelmingly support the idea of drastic government action on drug prices — with 9 out of 10 in favor of handing Medicare the power to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers.
Story Continued Below
But that bipartisan enthusiasm falters when Americans are confronted with the negative trade-offs tied to forcing prices lower, a finding that helps explain why lawmakers may have an easier time railing against skyrocketing drug prices than actually doing anything about them.
“This only suggests that this is a tempting issue for political people in both parties because it’s so popular,” said Robert Blendon, a Harvard professor of health policy and political analysis who designed the poll. “They’re going to find it much more controversial if they can’t answer the question of how you protect consumers from the potential downside.”
Support for Medicare negotiations with drug-makers, for example, dropped from 90 percent to just 42 percent when respondents weighed the risk that some pharmaceutical companies might respond by halting the sale of certain drugs to seniors. And while 80 percent favored limiting the price of drugs sold to state health programs, only 38 percent still liked the idea if it meant drug companies would spend less on research and development.
Those views were largely uniform across the political spectrum, reflecting the growing pressure on Washington to tackle drug prices. But it also shows the potency of the deep-pocketed pharmaceutical industry's arguments against government intervention.
“The industry is not going to do it because the industry is out to make money,” said Wendi Games, a New York Democrat who participated in the poll, of the need to tamp down drug prices. “It has to be a federal law, where the government gets involved.”
President Donald Trump has vowed to go after pharmaceutical companies he’s accused of “getting away with murder,” at one point siding with Democrats in favoring direct negotiating power for Medicare. However, his administration has backed off the idea, and is instead pushing for incremental changes aimed at creating more competition among drug companies and lowering patients' out-of-pocket costs.
Beyond drug pricing, the POLITICO-Harvard poll suggests the Trump administration could still find public traction in expanding access to experimental medicines for very sick patients.
Nearly 70 percent of Americans — with similar levels of support across party lines — like the idea of letting terminally ill patients seek new drugs that haven’t been fully tested, even after considering it could hurt patients or undermine the development of new drugs.
“It’s not going to harm them any worse than they already are,” said Nancy Fillip, an Illinois nurse and Republican who participated in the poll. ""I can tell you that I would do anything for my patient to get better, and if a drug might make somebody live six months longer, that’s six months their family has.”
However, the poll didn’t ask specifically about the “right-to-try” legislation Trump endorsed earlier this year and that failed in a House vote on Tuesday. Opponents of the measure point out that FDA already allows patients access to experimental medicines with its approval; the right-to-try bill, however, would let patients bypass the agency.
Despite bipartisan agreement on pharmaceutical issues, Americans remain deeply divided on Obamacare after a year of GOP efforts to repeal the law.
Half said the health care law is working about the same as a year ago, compared with 31 percent who believe it’s deteriorated and just 12 percent who think it has improved on the Trump administration’s watch.
Among those who believe the law is worsening, Republicans disproportionately blame congressional Democrats, while Democrats blame Trump and Republicans. Independents, meanwhile, spread the blame around a little more evenly, though most blame congressional Democrats.
Even though congressional Republicans managed to effectively wipe out the unpopular individual mandate, it hasn’t translated to warmer feelings about the law among the party’s voters. Half of Republicans said Obamacare is actually working worse than a year ago, versus just 10 percent of Democrats and one-third of independents.
“It’s a mess,” said Fillip, the Illinois nurse, who blamed Democrats and hard-line conservatives for the GOP’s failure last year to repeal and replace the law. “Nobody would come together, and that’s what makes me so mad about Congress.”
The few changes Republicans have made, such as wiping out the mandate penalty or pushing cheaper alternatives to Obamacare plans, haven’t yet pierced the public’s consciousness, Blendon said.
Much of the GOP rhetoric of the past year centered on repealing Obamacare entirely in order to stave off an insurance market collapse. That’s made it difficult now for Republicans to alter individual parts of Obamacare and convince voters those smaller victories will make a huge difference.
“A large share of people really either are now aware of them or don’t think these changes are having much of an impact,” Blendon said. “Looking back at their last year, they don’t see big changes.”

42565,Breitbart,"Author: Transgender Theology Trashes Truth, Threatens Teenagers","Are you confused by the new transgender ideology? Can’t keep track of its competing demands? Puzzled by the claim that biology is imaginary yet feelings are concrete?
If so, then you truly are on the path to wisdom, says Ryan Anderson, the level-headed analyst of transgender theology at the Heritage Foundation, and the author of a new book on transgender politics, titled “When Harry Became Sally.”
He sketches the slippery creativity of the transgender ideology in an article, titled “Transgender Ideology Is Riddled With Contradictions. Here Are the Big Ones.” He writes:
At the core of the ideology is the radical claim that feelings determine reality. From this idea come extreme demands for society to play along with subjective reality claims. Trans ideologues ignore contrary evidence and competing interests, they disparage alternative practices, and they aim to muffle skeptical voices and shut down any disagreement. The movement has to keep patching and shoring up its beliefs, policing the faithful, coercing the heretics, and punishing apostates, because as soon as its furious efforts flag for a moment or someone successfully stands up to it, the whole charade is exposed. That’s what happens when your dogmas are so contrary to obvious, basic, everyday truths. A transgender future is not the “right side of history,” yet activists have convinced the most powerful sectors of our society to acquiesce to their demands. While the claims they make are manifestly false, it will take real work to prevent the spread of these harmful ideas.
Read it all here.
There are very few “transgender” people. For example, advocates say from 250 to several thousand people in the military are trying to live like members of the other sex in a military population of 1.3 million full-time soldiers, sailors, marines and air force personnel. Fewer than o.3 percent of Americans wish to live as members of the opposite sex.
Polls show that roughly one-quarter of Americans support the progressive claim that biological sex trumps chosen “gender identity,” despite intense media pressure in favor of the pro-transgender, anti-sexes campaign.
The progressive push to bend Americans’ attitudes and their two-sex civic society around the idea of “gender” has already attacked and cracked popular social rules for how Americans handle the many social preferences of equal, different and complementary men and women, boys and girls.
For example, the gender claims have shifted rules or practices about different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents’ rights in childrearing, practices to help teenagers, women’s expectations of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men’s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, and children’s sexual privacy.",RIGHT

Enlarge this image LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR
""I'm 54 years old and my paycheck is $1,980 [a month]. I can't afford f****** health insurance.""
That's one of the first things Larry Cagle says on the phone. He is spitting nails. The Tulsa English teacher is one of the leaders of a grassroots organizing group, Oklahoma Teachers United, that they say represents thousands of public school teachers around the state. His group, and both of Oklahoma's teachers unions, support the walkout and rally happening across the state Monday in support of higher wages and more state revenue.
Teachers are striking even though state legislators passed a pay raise of about $6,000 last week. That vote followed earlier walkouts. The bill, if signed, would bring Oklahoma's teacher salaries from among the lowest in the nation, to the middle of the pack.
The Oklahoma teachers are not the only ones unhappy. Teachers in Kentucky are gathering Monday at the state capitol to press for education funding. Many schools there are on spring break, allowing teachers to travel to Frankfort. Schools not on spring break closed.
This wave of teacher-led actions around the country was kicked off when teachers in West Virginia emerged victorious from a nearly two-week strike earlier this month. In Arizona, hundreds of teachers walked out last week, and there have been rumbles as far away as New Mexico and Alaska.
The rally in Kentucky is led by the Kentucky Education Association, the state's union affiliate. But in many other states, grassroots teachers groups, like Larry Cagle's group in Oklahoma, have taken the lead — often using social media to organize.
Arizona Educators United, a grassroots group similar to Oklahoma Teachers United, has taken the helm in that state. The union affiliate, the Arizona Education Association, has offered its full support of protest efforts. ""They've really let us drive this and steer this,"" explains Noah Karvelis, one of the organizers of Arizona Educators United.
In Oklahoma, teachers like Cagle have stepped up, discontent with union leadership. Oklahoma is a right-to-work state, which means that employees don't have to join the unions there. The American Federation of Teachers has about 2,700 members out of 42,000 teachers. The state's other major union, the Oklahoma Education Association, says it has 40,000 members including many different kinds of school employees like bus drivers, retired teachers and education majors at Oklahoma colleges and universities.
That's a major reason that Cagle calls the unions ""weak and vulnerable."" He says his group has been forced to take matters into their own hands. ""We are the only unified protest group,"" he says. Teachers represented by Cagle's group want a $10,000 raise. ""We had 70 percent turnover in the last five years in my school,"" he says. ""You're not going to stop that with a $6,000 raise.""
If they don't get what they want, he threatens continuing protests into the summer and beyond.
They're also in it for the long-haul, advocating for a tax change to help pay for school funding that will be on the ballot in November.
Ed Allen, the leader of the Oklahoma City AFT, tells NPR he's never seen anything like this negotiation process in his 26 years with the union. ""Never have I ever thought"" that he'd be negotiating with lawmakers on the one side and teachers on the other, he says. ""How do you negotiate with Facebook?""
""We consider it a down payment,"" he said in a statement last week when his union accepted the budget deal. It's a nuanced position. He tells NPR that despite the ""passionate"" voices of those on social media, ""We don't see any way of getting any more money.""
That's not enough, says Brendan Jarvis, a middle school geography teacher just outside of Tulsa: ""[Legislators] are not talking about anything right now that teachers are happy with."" He's a board member of the Oklahoma Education Association, the state's biggest teachers union. The OEA didn't accept the deal.
Jarvis says he and other OEA members are walking out — and they're planning on staying out, until a plan is passed that teachers are happy with. At his school, educators are coordinating child care plans and working to feed students if lawmakers don't pass a deal that satisfies their demands.
""I've never been left out in the cold,"" by the union, says Ashley Robertson, a fouth-grade teacher and OEA member in Blanchard, Okla. She's attending the rally in the capitol with many of her colleagues.
Arizona teachers are watching
When the Oklahoma senate voted last week to increase teacher pay, thousands of Arizona teachers gathered in Phoenix at the capitol. Many wore buttons that read: I don't want to strike, but I will.
Noah Karvelis, one of the grassroots organizers of Arizona Educators United, says they want teacher pay increased by 20 percent and state education funding restored to 2008 levels. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said that won't happen.
Karvelis, a music teacher in Tolleson, Ariz., noticed the lack of funding right away when he arrived in the state to teach two years ago.
""There were days when I had more kids than chairs,"" he told NPR. Today, he has seven working keyboards to teach about 40 kids how to play piano. ""Every single kid that I've ever had deserves more than this. There are kids who are not being given a fair chance here.""
Karvelis says that, once a critical mass of teachers is on board with a walkout, ""the power is in our hands.""
Teachers in Arizona don't have a specific legislative deadline, or a date for a walkout. But the end of the school year is quickly approaching — and the end of the legislative session is, too.",LEFT

142174,BBC,Number of middle-aged renters doubles,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Paul McKay: 'It's just going to be renting until I die'
Forty-somethings are now almost twice as likely to be renting from a private landlord than they were 10 years ago.
Rising UK house prices have left many middle-age workers unable to afford a first home, or as ""accidental renters"" after a relationship break-up.
Analysts say a focus on young first-time buyers means older tenants, often with children, risk being ignored.
Concerns have been raised about the economic and social impact of these tenants in future years.
Future 'strain'
Data analysed for and by BBC News shows:
The proportion of 35 to 54-year-olds who live as private tenants has nearly doubled in 10 years since 2006-07, according to the Family Resources Survey by the Department for Work and Pensions
Renting among all age groups is now more likely to be from a private landlord than from a council or housing association
A particular rise in renting among 45 to 50-year-olds, sometimes as a result of death, debt or divorce, analysis for the BBC shows
Single parents with children who rent are a major concern among debt charities
""The danger of all this is the social inequality it will create between the haves - who are homeowners - and the have nots,"" said Paula Higgins, chief executive of the Homeowners' Alliance.
Richard Donnell, from property market analysts Hometrack, who studied the data for BBC News, pointed to the potential strain on the benefits system in 15 to 20 years' time when some of these tenants require financial assistance to pay the rent during retirement.
'Buying is off the radar'
Renting and house-sharing is a necessity for some - like Paul McKay, who has moved between a dozen rental properties in 20 years.
The 44-year-old retail worker, who lives in Kingston, Greater London, says that buying a home had previously felt out of reach, and now was completely off the radar.
""If I could go back in time, I would tell myself that the housing market might seem crazy now, but it is going to get crazier,"" he says.
Years ago, he decided that when prices breached £100,000 for a two-bedroom house, buying a property was too much of a risk.
""I know that now I'm ageing myself out of a mortgage, which is a slight concern. I don't feel I should be owed anything, but there is no support for my demographic, and there is still a stigma attached to renting in this country.""
Image caption Lesley Steele says that renting has given her some freedom
However, renting in middle-age is a more attractive option for some people. Lesley Steele, 51, lives in a converted pub in Cumbria which she shares with a housemate of similar age.
""I've always done a lot of travelling and did not want to be tied down paying a mortgage,"" she says. She generally works on short contracts in the education sector, and moved to Cumbria for the lifestyle and surroundings.
""I've never wanted to settle down and have kids. It would be lovely to have a base, but I prefer my freedom. The idea of a mortgage is scary, even now.""
She says she has savings so she will not face a financial ""crisis"" if she is left without a job, but has no long-term contingency plan.
'Accidental renters'
Record numbers of families are in rented accommodation and charities say there is a significant impact on the continuity of family and financial life.
Research by housing charity Shelter said two-thirds of private renters with families who it surveyed said they wished their children did not have to live in a privately rented home.
A fifth had moved from one rented home to another in the past five years, potentially affecting travel and schooling. One in six had been asked to move by the landlord.
Debt charity StepChange said that four in five of those seeking help for unmanageable debts were tenants. Many were single parents.
Most found themselves struggling with debts following a financial shock such as divorce or redundancy, rather than poor budgeting.
Mrs Higgins described many of those leaving long-term relationships as ""accidental renters"".
""People are stretched to the limit and have insecure wages. When they split up, a couple can't each buy a property in the same area that lets them share the children,"" she said.
Buying to renting
In the 10 years to April 2017, the proportion of people renting their home from a private landlord increased across all working age groups, the latest figures show. At the same time the proportion of homeowners with a mortgage fell among those of working age.
Overall, 20% of UK households were renting privately by 2017, compared to 28% who own with a mortgage, according to the Family Resources Survey by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Of the rest, 34% own their home outright and 17% are in the social renting sector.
Since the start of the decade, there has been a greater proportion who pay rent to a private landlord than social housing tenants.
Nearly half of 25 to 34-year-olds rented their home privately by 2017, but the largest increase over the 10 years during and after the financial crisis were 35 to 44-year-olds. The proportion of private renters in this age group doubled from 13% to 26%.
The proportion of 45 to 54-year-olds renting from a private landlord rose from 8% to 14% over the same period.
BBC News has set up a new UK Facebook group all about affordable living. Join the Affordable Living group here.
A recent report by the Resolution Foundation suggested that up to a third of young people face living in private rented accommodation all their lives.
It called for more affordable homes for first-time buyers to be built, as well as better protection for those who rent, and said the tax system should be changed to discourage second-home ownership. It also suggested ""light touch"" stabilisation policies to limit rent increases to the rate of inflation over a three-year period.
But one landlords' trade body said any kind of rent control would be a disaster for the sector.",UNDEFINED

179821,The Guardian,"The Tories’ chaotic Brexit has lost the trust of business, and jobs will go","Early summer, and Westminster politics is a glorified beach read. Will the former SAS (Reserve) hardman David Davis stay or go? How long can dogged Theresa May keep her job? And when will the pinstriped assassin Jacob Rees-Mogg strike next? Grab another drink, slap on the Soltan, and all shall be revealed on page 194. What larks! Yet away from parliament, and far from the tabloid front pages, a serious breach is opening up in British politics. Last week some of the most senior business leaders in Britain came out of a Brexit meeting at No 10, and promptly tore the prime minister to shreds. “We’re playing economics; [the politicians] are playing politics,” said Paul Drechsler, president of the bosses’ organisation, the Confederation of British Industry. “In the world of business, we’re frustrated. We’re angry.”
An extraordinary statement, especially from an executive invited to tea and biscuits with May. If supposedly tame industrialists now talk like this, you have to wonder what sounds come out of the feral lot.
Yet the CBI’s impatience is shared by many. Once the long-haul arm of the Tory movement, the Freight Transport Association lashed out at May last week for “playing chicken with crucial parts of the British economy and the livelihoods of … 7 million Britons”.
These are close friends of the Conservative party.As one senior representative of a leading business organisation says: “Over the past two years, most company bosses would never risk saying openly that Brexit is turning out to be a disaster, in case it scared off their best staff.” With fewer than 290 days before Britain formally leaves the EU, their caution is running out.
This is a far bigger story than the one on the front pages about who promised which amendment to which band of Tories. One of the fundamental relationships in the establishment is fracturing – and the consequences for government and economy could prove to be historic.

An iron rule of British politics is that the Conservatives mean business, and business means the Conservatives. Despite an early falling-out with Margaret Thatcher and a dalliance with Tony Blair, blue remains home corner for commercial companies and champions of cutting taxes and trimming red tape to a minimum. Yet in May’s two years as prime minister, business has either been cast as the enemy or relegated to a walk-on part. In that chaotic summer of 2016, as senior Tories stabbed each other in the back and themselves in the front, May was quick to grasp that many leave voters were sticking up two fingers at the British way of doing capitalism. Neither an ex-banker nor marinaded in Treasury culture, she happily blasted “unscrupulous bosses” and “corporate irresponsibility”. Among her aides was the enthusiastic leaver, Nick Timothy, whose masterplan was to use Brexit to win over working-class voters who had been chucked overboard by New Labour.
Once in No 10, May’s schemes for putting workers on company boards and blocking Chinese funding of British nuclear plants turned to dust. Yet on the central policy issue of our time, business remains stuck in a non-speaking role.
Quick guide What is the EU withdrawal bill? Show Hide What is the EU withdrawal bill? The EU Withdrawal Bill – once known as the Great Repeal Bill – is going through the House of Commons to repeal the 1972 European Communities Act and transpose all existing EU legislation into domestic UK law, which will avoid a 'cliff-edge' change on the day after we leave the EU. Parts of the bill have been highly controversial, and MPs have tabled hundreds of amendments to try and change its wording, including a significant number of Conservative rebels. Some of the key controversies include its use of so-called Henry VIII powers, which will give government ministers the power to tweak the wording of laws to make sure they make sense in UK legislation - but those changes could take place without having to go through parliament. MPs have called this a ""power grab"" by the government. The government estimates around 800 to 1,000 measures called statutory instruments will be required to make sure the bill is applied correctly. Other concerns include the government's decision not to include the EU charter of fundamental rights in the law being transposed. Other amendments are attempts to affect the Brexit process, including legislating for a transitional period and giving MPs a binding meaningful vote on the deal secured by Theresa May, before the deal is finalised.
Take the all-important triggering of article 50: May announced it in her first conference speech as leader, just weeks after the referendum vote and before parliament had resumed. Forget about consulting industry and finance: she didn’t even give them notice.
After last summer’s election debacle, and Timothy’s exit, May’s new team set up a conciliatory business advisory council that meets in Downing Street every three months or so. A long way short of the Brexit business task force called for by the CBI and others, its rotating membership – one month WPP, the next Rolls-Royce – makes it almost useless as a forum for formal input. Unsurprisingly, it was after one of these council meetings that Drechsler exploded.
Ministers and aides try to calm the waters. Their efforts, while appreciated by people in business I have spoken to, are rendered void against the bungling and botching that marks the negotiations. The tens of billions taxpayers give business in subsidies and tax reliefs are now taken for granted. For as long as Brexit is treated by May first and foremost as a way to keep her own cabinet and party together, the private sector will remain frozen out. Anything else it would like – from a third runway at Heathrow to a proper industrial strategy – gets parked on the long list marked “any other business”.

Imagine you are a senior manager at a major carmaker. Over the past two years, you have been assured that you would continue to “operate within” the European single market. Except that turned into “frictionless” trade – which then became “as frictionless as possible”. Meanwhile, the cabinet dreams up “customs partnerships” and other unicorns destined only to be waved away by Michel Barnier – and Boris Johnson is wittering on about yet another bloody bridge. How are you meant to plan around any of that? The answer is that the worst-case scenarios your team drew up in 2016 are, by 2018, your base case.
No longer is it just banks and pharmaceutical firms looking overseas. Britain’s biggest car manufacturer, Jaguar Land Rover, warned this week it would shift production of its Discovery 4x4 from Solihull to EU member Slovakia. That can be explained away as focusing Midlands staff on making electric cars – but just last September, the firm said its presence in Slovakia was a “hedge” against Brexit uncertainty.

The problem this poses for the rest of us is very real and very easy to sum up. Among all the 28 members of the EU, the UK ranks second only to Ireland on its level of inward investment. As Kevin Farnsworth at the University of York points out, from Thatcher onwards, British governments have touted for capital investment from abroad. It’s why George Osborne cut corporation tax so low and went on tours of China and India. It’s also why the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, says the UK relies on “the kindness of strangers”. That dependence has grown as Britain has lost more and more of its own businesses and become instead a branch-plant economy for the rest of the world. And that kindness is now being strained by a blundering Brexit. Soon the headlines will be not just about a few hundred jobs moving out of the City – but of firms scrapping their expansion plans, or factories shifting to Poland, or thousands of jobs going at a stroke of a pen.
It was always a rotten and unsafe model. The irony is, it is a Conservative government that now appears intent on tearing it down – with nothing to replace it. In place of a strategy, you get the panic that broke out in Downing Street when Nissan threatened to take its money elsewhere – resulting in a private meeting with the Japanese carmaker and a series of promises made in a secret “comfort letter”. This is no more an economic policy than a bunch of flowers bought at a service station is a Valentine’s present.
But then, this has been the decade in which the political and policymaking elite has inflicted upon itself wound after wound. First came the fiasco of austerity, and an economy that refused to bounce back as Osborne and Carney promised it would. Then came the Brexit referendum that Cameron claimed he had in the bag. And that has produced the slow dissolution of the Tory-corporate coalition central to contemporary British capitalism.
With all that as the background, why wouldn’t you opt for a bit of beach-reading escapism?

104766,CNN,"When it comes to Syria, Trump can tweet and launch strikes if he wants, but not much else","(CNN) It may be more difficult than President Donald Trump might wish to make Iran and Russia pay a ""big price"" for the suspected chemical attack in Syria over the weekend, one that he has accused the Syrian regime of carrying out with the support of its allies in Moscow and Tehran.
If the ""price"" for the attack was punishing airstrikes against the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the White House isn't saying. Syrian state television claimed that early Monday morning that airstrikes targeted an air base in Homs , a strategic staging ground for Russian and Syrian forces. The Pentagon said it wasn't involved in any strikes in Syria, and Russia says the Israelis sent two F-15 fighter jets into Syrian airspace and launched eight missiles at the T-4 air base. The Russian Defense Ministry claims ""Syrian air defense units"" shot down five of the guided missiles.
The US President may find it problematic to deliver consequences in a conflict he has worked to shed any responsibility for. Last week, while he told the world he wanted to withdraw American troops from northern Syria , the three world leaders largely behind Assad's survival met to discuss the way forward as they saw it. There was no American presence as the leaders of Turkey, Iran and Russia met , and no indication that the US would be included in discussions in the future.
There appeared to be little the President could actually do. On Sunday, he took to Twitter to shift the blame for the events in Syria to his predecessor, Barack Obama.
""If President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line In The Sand, the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago! Animal Assad would have been history!"" Trump posted on Twitter
""OK, Barack Obama made some mistakes,"" said Fawaz Gerges , a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. ""Is President Trump committed? Does he have the desire and the will to basically become engaged in Syria? This is the question,"" he told CNN.
Unilaterally forfeiting American influence
Trump came into office determined to undo many of Obama's policies, dissolve treaties he deemed against American interests and eager to avoid being drawn into conflicts abroad that he'd argued were costly and unnecessary.
But months in, Trump authorized his own military strike against a Syrian government air base after a chemical weapons attack killed dozens of civilians earlier in the city of Khan Sheikhoun. US warships launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at the base that was headquarters for the warplanes that carried out the chemical attacks.
Trump's decision at the time was viewed as a dramatic shift in his position on the presence of American troops in Syria. Footage showing ""innocent babies"" killed by chemical gas, ""crosses many, many lines. Beyond a red line, many, many lines,"" Trump said then.
JUST WATCHED Trump: Putin, Iran responsible for backing Assad Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: Putin, Iran responsible for backing Assad 01:16
Now a year later, Trump is back to bemoaning the American excursion in northern Syria.
He has signaled his intent to withdraw US troops and to scale back the country's involvement in the fight against the remnants of the Islamic State. He's reportedly unhappy with the amount of money the US was spending in the region, and has questioned the results of that expenditure. But after tense discussions with his national security team, he's agreed to hold off on ordering the withdrawal.
That decision has ""unilaterally forfeited any American influence in helping shape Syria's future,"" Fawaz Gerges told CNN. ""Trump's fateful decision will reinforce the widespread perception, among both friends and foes of the United States, that America is in retreat in Syria and beyond, unwilling to shoulder the burden of global leadership. It is also an explicit acknowledgment that the United States and its Syrian allies have lost the war.""
An unresolvable conundrum
Ostensibly, the United States has been in Syria for years now to battle elements of the Islamic State. Its troops had allied with Kurdish militias and other partners on the ground (in Iraq it was the Iraqi army and Shiite militias) to wrest back territory seized by the extremists across a swath of Iraq and Syria.
From early on, the Obama administration chose to distinguish its fight in Syria as focused largely against ISIS, and maintained its position regarding the Syrian regime to be in line with sanctions and pressure from the international community, but without any military leverage.
""US policy toward Syria has been debilitated by an irresolvable conundrum. While the US has led the fight against ISIS, in the broader Syrian context, it has been a secondary player reacting to adversaries who ignored the mantra that 'there is no military solution in Syria,'"" wrote Emile Hokayem and Karim Sadjadpour at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace

Russian President Vladimir Putin has supported Assad throughout years of international condemnation. His steadfastness has earned him visits from other Arab leaders who were disappointed with the Obama administration's support of Arab revolutions that unseated their cohorts. America's ebbing influence from the international scene has allowed Putin to assume a larger role and greater influence that he has emphasized in his ties to the Syrian regime.
""Russia has history, a defense pact, and close political relations with Damascus. Iran has more recent strategic links, growing commercial interests, and controls thousands of pro-Tehran militias in addition to its own troops across the country,"" said Rodger Shanahan at the Lowy Institute in Australia. Turkey too, has commercial interests, hundreds of miles of a shared border, and hosts (under the dime of the European Union) hundreds of thousands of Syrians in its country.
Déjà vu at the UN
There are more meetings called at the United Nations Security Council, but with the Russians ready to veto any measures that are too punitive, there's likely to be little accomplished beyond more speeches from Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the international body. She tweeted on Sunday about an emergency meeting to be held Monday to discuss the ""horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians in Syria.""
""This is becoming all too common. Strong action is needed,"" she said on Twitter. But it's not clear what form that strong action might take.
On the Sunday talk shows, Republicans, including Sens. Lindsey Graham and John McCain, called on Trump to respond ""decisively"" to ""demonstrate that Assad will pay the price for his crimes.""

One way Trump could punish Syria would be to press Iran's trading partners to exert economic pressure on Iran to curtail its ability to provide Syria with military support, but there's a catch, say Hokayem and Sadjadpour.
""Persuading US allies to do more to counter Iran's destructive regional policies will require continued US adherence to the JCPOA (the Iran nuclear deal) -- a worthy trade-off,"" they write. ""Washington should simultaneously continue to expose the high costs of Iran's regional policies ... at a time of growing economic and political discontent in Iran.""
But Trump opposes the deal with Iran. In January, he said it was the last time he was issuing a waiver denoting that Iran was complying with the agreement. He said he was doing so ""only in order to secure our European allies' agreement to fix the terrible flaws"" of the deal. He warned the US would not ""again waive sanctions in order to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. If at any time I judge that such an agreement is not within reach, I will withdraw from the deal immediately.""
""With President Trump's nearing his decision on the nuclear agreement with Iran, there is a real and present danger that Syria will become the battleground for an even more dangerous conflagration than the war that is continuing on its torturous route,"" noted the LSE's Fawaz Gerges.

On Russia, Trump should ""seek to exacerbate, not ease, Russia's political and economic dilemmas in Syria,"" given Assad's reliance on the Russian military that has allowed him to survive for years now, Hokayem and Sadjadpour write. ""The more Assad feels secure thanks to Russian help, the less inclined he is to make even the smallest concessions encouraged by Moscow.""
As it is, the US and Russia are already locked in a diplomatic battle of wills, fallout from election interference and the poisoning of a Russian double agent in the English city of Salisbury, allegedly at the hands of the Kremlin. Last week sanctions were finally announced against Russian individuals , troll farms and intelligence agencies.
A lack of strategic levers
There was little follow up from Trump after he ordered the military airstrikes on Syria in April 2017. Before he was unceremoniously dismissed, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that US troops would leave Syria based on conditions on the ground , and not an aribitrary timeline.
""From a negotiator's viewpoint, the lack of a timeline is good, but only if the parties you're dealing with know you have significant leverage to exert. The challenge for Washington's Syria policy all along has been its lack of strategic levers,"" wrote Shanahan of the Lowy Institute.

Without any real strategy, and with a commander-in-chief declaring his readiness to remove American troops from the battlefield before the war is over, Trump will not only fail to punish Assad, he will embolden the Syrian President.
""The not unreasonable conclusion that is being drawn is that Assad will stay in power and he will not be forced to make any concessions to the battered opposition,"" says Gerges. ""If so, Assad will forge ahead with his ruthless plan -- buttressed by Russian and Iranian support -- to recapture the remaining Syrian territories held by the rebels.""
""With the US absence, the key stakeholders in Syria ... will consolidate their spheres of influence and divide the spoils of the post-war reconstruction amongst themselves,"" he said, adding that ""Russia and Iran will be the two biggest winners in Syria.""",UNDEFINED
87202,CBS News,Trade war with China could hurt these U.S. businesses most,"It is how trade wars catch flame. President Donald Trump has proposed tariffs on aerospace, machinery, and information and communications technology products imported from China. Beijing swiftly replied with its own tariffs on U.S. fruits, wine, steel pipe and pork, among other goods.
Here at home, some industries are particularly at risk. That's because companies in these sectors not only import parts and materials from China, but also often export finished products there as well.
There are three primary mechanisms by which U.S. tariffs on China could hurt American companies. Tariffs on Chinese imports would increase the cost of raw materials for U.S. businesses, forcing them to pay more to make the same goods, whether cars, appliances or electronics. China's reciprocal tariffs make U.S. goods more expensive for Chinese consumers, hurting the many businesses trying their luck in the world's largest market.
Finally, China could make it hard for American companies to do business using other methods, such as increasing regulations on U.S. companies in China or slowing down deals.
""The retaliation could turn into dissuading Chinese consumers and Chinese businesses from buying U.S. products and brands,"" Keith Parker, a strategist at UBS, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""There's lots of things that can be done, if trade tensions were to escalate, whether it's influencing purchasing decisions or making exports to the U.S. more difficult.""
Technology and electronics
U.S. technology companies rank particularly high on the list of potential losers because many of them are exposed in multiple ways: They rely on Chinese suppliers, and they sell to Chinese companies. UBS, which compiled a list of public companies with significant sales in China, noted that cell phones, computer equipment, semiconductors and clothing were potentially the most vulnerable products if Beijing chooses to hit back.
""All iPhones come out of China,"" said Jeff Fieldhack, an analyst at Counterpoint Research. ""And other U.S. companies, even if their R&D and development is here in the U.S., they're still making their parts and assembly in China.""
Apple (AAPL) is exposed to China in several ways: It relies on Chinese factories for assembly; China has an effective lock on the rare-earth minerals essential for Apple products; and China's fast-growing middle class is increasingly important for Apple's consumer strategy. Some 20 percent of Apple's sales last year were in China.
""China is the biggest market to over 100 countries. It's hard to find another country with that kind of demand,"" said Ann Lee, a former professor at Peking University and author of ""Why China's Economy Collapsed."" ""If the U.S. goes forward, you could see blowback that could hurt companies and workers.""
Boeing
Boeing (BA) stock, which plunged when the U.S. announced steel and aluminum tariffs in February, continued to drop Wednesday, reflecting the company's vulnerability to international tensions.
China has unique leverage because it buys so many of Boeing's planes. It signed a deal to buy 300 Boeing planes during Mr. Trump's fall visit to the country. Over the next two decades, China is projected to order around $1 trillion worth of aircraft, according to Bloomberg.
After the U.S., ""China is the largest market for Boeing aircraft in the world; it's about 20-25 percent of aircraft deliveries every year,"" said Chris Higgins, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. ""They don't really need to enact tariffs to retaliate on Boeing; all they need to do is shift purchases to Airbus.""
""If they announce a large order for Airbus aircraft tomorrow, that would send a message,"" he added.
A lesser risk is the rising cost of metal itself. Because aircraft are made primarily of steel and aluminum, an increase in those costs would ding its profit margins. Aluminum, which makes up nearly 80 percent of an airplane's body weight, is set to get 10 percent pricier after the tariffs.
But the industry is relatively used to volatile commodity prices, said Higgins -- aluminum prices rose nearly 25 percent last year with ""hardly a peep"" from the aerospace industry. (Steel, while it's subject to heavier 25 percent tariffs, makes up only about 10 percent of an airplane's weight.)
Soybeans
Some of the fiercest opposition to tariffs is coming from a sector that has, so far, been spared retaliation: soybeans. Soybean farmers sent $14 billion of crops to China last year and see themselves as a prime target for countermeasures.
""We're very concerned about the type of retaliation we might get,"" said Wayne Fredericks, who grows soybeans and corn on 750 acres in northern Iowa. ""The soybean industry is sitting in the bull's eye of Chinese retaliatory efforts.""
Wayne Fredericks
China is the biggest customer for U.S. soybeans, buying one-third of our soybean crop last year. That number, which has increased exponentially over the last 15 years, is driven by the Chinese middle class' growing appetite for meat. The soybeans are pressed and used for animal feed and, to a lesser degree, for cooking oil.
""As income levels have risen in China, diets have shifted more and more to meat consumption,"" said Joseph Glauber, senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute. ""They've modernized their pork and poultry production, so it looks a lot like the U.S., and they feed them much like we do in the U.S."" -- that is to say, with soybeans and corn. Sorghum and barley have also benefited from this growth to a lesser degree.
For its part, China has accused the U.S. government of unfairly subsidizing the soybean industry to flood the markets (the very same tactic of which Mr. Trump accuses the Chinese.)
""Certainly these issues are not new,"" said Kirk Leeds, director of business development for the Iowa Soybean Association (ISA). ""What appears to be different is the Trump administration is taking what appears to be a much more aggressive position. That makes many of us nervous.""
Leeds, who is leading an ISA delegation on a two-week trip to China, spoke to CBS News from a high-speed train between Beijing and Wuhan. His group had just met with the U.S. ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, who is also Iowa's former governor.
""I think the next couple weeks could be critical,"" he said. ""Everyone is aware over here, everyone's paying attention to us and most [people] are hoping that there will be a firm resolution.""
Financial firms
In October, China loosened regulations on foreign ownership of Chinese banks, a step the U.S. finance industry lauded as historic. With the U.S. contemplating tariffs—not to mention knocking down Chinese ownership of U.S. companies—observers worry China could reverse its steps.
""That was a huge offer from the Chinese, and that could completely go down the drain with these kinds of tariffs,"" said Lee. ""The Chinese will say, 'Why should we be bending over backwards when you don't want to establish a stronger relationship?'""
In nearly all other sectors, Chinese rules on foreign companies remain famously strict (a fact that Mr. Trump highlighted on Thursday).
""U.S. companies, tech companies and high-value-add companies are in essence forced to partner with a domestic producer in China. That's one area where policymakers could tighten the screws,"" said Peter Donisanu, investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo.
With higher barriers to ownership, U.S. companies could conclude it's easier to sell their share of an enterprise and essentially exit the Chinese market.
Hard bargain
Given the potential of tariffs to hurt hundreds of U.S. businesses, many analysts are choosing to see Thursday's announcement not as the last word, but rather as an opening gambit aimed at bringing China to the bargaining table.
""For now this seems to be about renegotiating trade deals,"" said Donisanu, citing the examples of steel and aluminum tariffs, which were watered down significantly before they even came into effect.
But even if the final tariffs are small numerically, a prolonged negotiation between the U.S. and China could have other consequences. Decisions about supply chains, factories, hiring and firing can take years to fully play out. In the meantime, American industry has two weeks to press the case for particular tariffs—and to fret about the results.
""Maybe in a few years we can look back and say, as convoluted as this strategy is, it was beneficial for the U.S.,"" said Fredericks, the soybean farmer. ""But the process is pretty painful.""

158998,Politico,Ex-aides say congressman and wife made them his servants,"Virginia Rep. Tom Garrett and his wife turned the congressman’s staff into personal servants, multiple former employees to the freshman Republican told POLITICO — assigning them tasks from grocery shopping to fetching the congressman’s clothes to caring for their pet dog, all during work hours.
POLITICO has spoken with four former staffers who detailed a deeply dysfunctional office, where the congressman and his wife, Flanna, often demanded that staff run personal errands outside their typical congressional duties. The couple called on staff to pick up groceries, chauffeur Garrett’s daughters to and from his Virginia district, and fetch clothes that the congressman forgot at his Washington apartment. They were even expected to watch and clean up after Sophie, their Jack Russell-Pomeranian mix, the aides said.
Story Continued Below
The staffers said they feared that if they refused Garrett‘s or his wife’s orders — both were known for explosive tempers — they would struggle to advance in their careers. It wasn't just full-time staff: many of the allegedly inappropriate requests were made of interns, the former aides said.
“I didn’t know who I was working for: Was I working for him? Was I working for her?” said one of those staffers who, like others interviewed for this story, asked not to be named for fear of retribution. “We became their gofers.”
A spokesman for Garrett, Matt Missen, declined to address a detailed list of complaints about the office.

“We see no reason to respond to anonymous, unfounded allegations primarily targeting Congressman Garrett’s wife, made by POLITICO’s ‘unnamed’ sources,” he said. “It is easy to spread untruths and even easier to exaggerate and imply wrongdoing when none exists.”
The behind-the-scenes turmoil boiled over Tuesday evening, when Garrett’s chief of staff, Jimmy Keady, abruptly parted ways with the congressman. His exit, multiple sources say, came amid a dispute with Garrett over the couple’s alleged misuse of official resources. Multiple sources raised the issue with the congressman, and senior staffers tried to rectify the situation repeatedly.
On Wednesday, Garrett, a 46-year-old Army veteran and former state senator, began telling associates that he was considering not running for reelection — stunning Republicans in Virginia and Washington. But a day later, he reversed course, saying during a rambling 30-minute news conference that he would in fact seek another term.
“There is no way in heck that I’m not going to be back here in 2019 as a member of the Congress representing the 5th District of Virginia. Too darn much is at stake,” Garrett told reporters.
Much of the controversy stemmed from Garrett’s wife, Flanna, a frequent presence in his House office. Former staffers said she comes to work with him on most weekdays.
Early in his tenure, staffers say, Flanna began asking aides to perform what they considered to be tasks that were unofficial and personal in nature. One staffer recalled an instance in which he had been asked to pick her up from the grocery store, drive her to the couple’s apartment and help her unload groceries. Tom Garrett was at a baseball game and was unable to help, the staffer was told at the time.
Garrett also had staffers run errands for him. From time to time, two former staffers recalled, the congressman would arrive to work having forgotten to wear a belt or with a stain on his shirt, they said. Garrett, they said, would dispatch aides to his apartment to pick up fresh clothes for him.
Aides also grew acquainted with the couple’s dog, who often came to the office with the Garretts. Staffers were expected to watch the dog during office hours, and one aide did so over a weekend. Several aides said the couple would sometimes seem to forget the dog was in the office. When that happened, at the end of the day, aides were responsible for transporting it back to Garrett’s Washington apartment.
One source said the dog occasionally defecated on the floor and aides had to clean up the mess.
Aides also served as drivers for the congressman’s older daughters from a previous marriage, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter. Interns or other staffers were sent to Scottsdale, Virginia, where the two lived in Garrett’s district, to pick them up and bring them to Washington. Scottsdale is a three-hour drive from D.C.
Garrett’s conduct could raise ethics concerns. The House Ethics manual prohibits lawmakers from using staff for anything other than official congressional duties. Members are explicitly barred from instructing aides to do personal errands in the manual, which also recounts situations in which staff were wrongly told to fetch personal mail, clean a member’s home and pay a member’s bills.
Missen said there is “no ethics investigation” into the office and that “to ensure that all staff follow the rules, Congressman Garrett has had lawyers from the House Ethics Committee meet with him and his staff (to include district staff via telephone) to brief everyone on the ethics rules pertaining to congressmen and staff, and to answer any questions.”
Staffer say the atmosphere in the office was toxic, however, and the demands were far outside what should reasonably be expected of congressional aides. Flanna would reach out to aides at all hours of the night, according to two former staffers. One person recalled an incident in which Flanna lashed out at a staffer for not picking up the congressman from his apartment after he overslept.
Former aides said they were afraid to refuse Flanna’s instructions. Some said they performed them without protest because they worried they’d be fired.
Others, however, left because they couldn’t take it anymore. Since taking office in January 2017, Garrett has had among the highest levels of turnover in the House, according to records compiled by legislative data company LegiStorm . More than 60 percent of his staff left in 2017, compared with the House’s typical 25 percent turnover rate that year, making the office fourth out of more than 400 legislative shops.
“I came aboard because I really, really believed in the message being presented and believed in Garrett as a person and as congressman,” said one the former aides. “I can take hard work. What I can’t put up with is these just mundane tasks that [were] being asked to be completed by him and his wife that had nothing to do with the job.”
That same staffer said he told a senior aide that running the Garretts’ personal errands was “effed up.” The senior staffer responded that if he couldn’t handle it, this was not the job for him.
Just hours before his news conference on Thursday, Garrett decided he wanted one of his departed staffers back.
That morning, he tried to hire back Keady, the former chief of staff who objected to the congressman’s use of office resources.
Keady declined the offer.

23511,USA Today,Sessions acknowledges missing FBI texts,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions (Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images)
WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions acknowledged Monday that the FBI's information system failed to preserve five months of text messages between two bureau officials who had disparaged then-candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 election.
The discovery of the communications earlier this year prompted the removal of Peter Strzok, a senior counter-intelligence agent, from the staff of Russia special counsel Robert Mueller.
Strzok had been communicating by text message for months with colleague Lisa Page, who also had been assigned to Mueller's team, but had returned her duties at the FBI before the text messages were found.
The Justice Department turned over a tranche of communications between the two officials to Congress last month covering a period between August 2015 to December 2016. In those contacts, Strzok, who also helped run the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, referred to Trump as an ""idiot"" and the two expressed a clear preference for the Democratic candidate.
More: Peter Strzok, FBI agent removed from Robert Mueller's Russia probe, called Trump an 'idiot'
Related: FBI agent assigned to Russia investigation removed after anti-Trump texts
In all, Justice identified about 50,000 messages between the two.
In a statement Monday, Sessions said the FBI had not retained messages between the two, from Dec.14, 2016 to May 17, 2017, the day Mueller was appointed to lead Justice's inquiry into Russia interference in the 2016 election.
Mueller's appointment followed Sessions' decision to recuse himself from overseeing that matter because he failed to disclose pre-election meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.
A number of congressional panels have requested the text communications between Strzok and Page to examine whether Mueller's investigation was biased against Trump. The texts were first discovered this summer by the Justice Department's inspector general who is in the midst of a wide-ranging review of the department's handling of the Clinton investigation.
“The department apprised the congressional committees of the missing text messages on Friday,"" Sessions said. ""I have spoken to the inspector general and a review is already underway to ascertain what occurred and to determine if these records can be recovered in any other way. If any wrongdoing were to be found to have caused this gap, appropriate legal disciplinary action measures will be taken.
“We will leave no stone un-turned to confirm with certainty why these text messages are not now available to be produced and will use every technology available to determine whether the missing messages are recoverable from another source,"" Sessions said.
Republican lawmakers have seized on the text communications to question the credibility of Mueller's continuing inquiry and to call for a second special counsel to examine the FBI's handling of the matter.
In a statement Monday, the Republican chairmen of three influential House panels--the Intelligence, Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees--called the missing communications ""concerning.""
The missing messages, the chairmen said, represent a ""critical gap encompassing the FBI's Russia investigation.""

74550,Reuters,UPDATE 1-Air France rejects wage demands as another strike looms,"(Adds unions to meet on Thursday to decide on strike)
PARIS, March 13 (Reuters) - Air France said on Tuesday it had rejected a demand by staff for a 6 percent wage increase and instead offered unions to compensate workers for any reduction in spending power since 2011, hoping to avert a planned March 23 strike.
The carrier said its workers’ demands were impossible to meet in the current financial situation without compromising the company’s growth strategy, and proposed negotiations.
“As a result, at the end of these negotiations, no Air France employee will have seen their purchasing power decrease over this period,” the company said in the statement.
“Management has asked the unions to lift their strike notice and has indicated that it is willing to begin talks as quickly as possible,” it added.
The unions, which called the strike last week after failing to reach a deal, said they would meet on Thursday to decide whether to extend the planned strike to a two-day stoppage.
A walkout last month resulted in the cancellation of more than half of the company’s long-haul flights. (Reporting by Cyril Altmeyer and Bate Felix Editing by Richard Lough and Mark Potter)",CENTER
86902,HuffPost,Last Nun In Property Dispute With Katy Perry Pledges To Continue The Fight,"Sister Rita Callanan is the last surviving member of a group of nuns who’ve been entangled in a property dispute with pop star Katy Perry for years.
But even after Callanan’s sole remaining sister in the fight died during a court hearing earlier this month, and despite the fact that a judge has already ruled against her, she has pledged to continue her battle against the celebrity singer.
“I’m not going to give up,” the 79-year-old nun told The Daily Beast on Thursday about her mission to assert rights over her former California convent, a hilltop property in the Los Feliz neighborhood with spectacular views of downtown Los Angeles.
“I just feel that Katy Perry is used to getting all she wants, and to her money means everything, and to her, whatever Katy wants, Katy gets,” she added.
Callanan is a member of the Sisters of the Most Holy And Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The nuns claimed they bought the estate in 1971, pooling together income they had earned as teachers in Los Angeles parochial schools.
Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images The former home of Sisters of the Most Holy and Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary is located in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles.
But since 2015, the nuns have been involved in a heated dispute with the Archdiocese of Los Angeles over who has the right to sell the property. The archdiocese struck a deal with Perry to sell the 8-acre property for $14.5 million. Perry has reportedly said she wants to live on the property with her mother and grandmother.
The Los Angeles Archdiocese claims the property was no longer suitable for the elderly women. The nuns moved out of the convent in 2011.
“There are a lot of stairs, and it’s a really big space as well,” Adrian Alarcon, a senior spokesperson for the archdiocese, told The Daily Beast. “A lot of the sisters now live in assisted living homes or retirement homes where they can get the proper care they need.”
Callanan and fellow sister Catherine Rose Holzman attempted to sell the property to a local restaurateur, Dana Hollister, for $15.5 million, according to the Los Angeles Times. Hollister reportedly wanted to turn the property into a hotel.
A Los Angeles County superior court judge ruled that the nuns’ sale was invalid in March 2017.
Canon law dictates that the sale of any property for more than $7.5 million requires the Vatican’s approval. The judge found that nuns did not receive permission from the pope, the Holy See or their local archbishop for the sale, the Los Angeles Times reports.
In November, a jury decided that Hollister had intentionally interfered with the sale. The jury awarded the archdiocese $3.47 million in lawyer’s fees, while Perry’s company, Bird Nest LLC, was awarded $1.57 million in fees.
“I am thrilled with the outcome,” Perry’s manager, Steve Jensen, told the Los Angeles Times in November. “It just proves that we have been right all the way along.”
Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images The 8-acre property features panoramic views and Roman villa-style buildings.
On March 9, Holzman collapsed and died during a post-judgment hearing related to the dispute. She was 89 years old.
Holzman spoke to Los Angeles station KTTV about the fight with Perry hours before her death. It would end up being her final interview.
“To Katy Perry, please stop. It’s not doing anyone any good except hurting a lot of people,” Holzman told the station.
Callanan started a GoFundMe page in October 2017 to help raise money for the legal fight. She’s raised over $38,000 so far.
The nun mourned the loss of her “cherished partner” Holzman in an update she posted to the page on March 10.",LEFT

It was these screams, and finding herself – a 25-year-old navy nurse – part of an “unconscionable military machine” that fixed men up only to send them straight back into bloody battle, that drove her to one of the great acts of anti-Vietnam war defiance.

“I knew that the airforce was dropping flyers on the Vietnamese urging them to get away from the bombing and the spraying of agent orange, and I thought, ‘if the United States can do that there, why can’t we do that here?” said Schnall. Her anti-war statement, like so many that came after it, did not come without sacrifice. She was court martialled and sentenced to six months hard labour – though in the end never served her sentence.

Schnall is just one of the dozen of veterans who are visiting Vietnam for the opening of an exhibition that honours the almost-forgotten yet pivotal role that active duty servicemen men and women played in the anti-war movement.
Schnall is one of many who feature in the exhibition, held at the War Remnants museum in Vietnam’s capital Ho Chi Minh City. A picture of her leading the GI anti-war march days before she was court martialled will hang in pride of place, alongside newsletters, posters and handwritten letters and photographs, most of which have never been exhibited.
While the stereotypical image of the Vietnam anti-war protester is hippies on campus, flowers in hand, by 1968 every major demonstration was actually led by active-duty officers. Most had returned so horrified by what they had seen and done, they became the most vocal and forceful voices in the anti-war movement.
The exhibition, titled Waging Peace, opens in the midst of the 50th anniversary of the Tet Offensive – a brutal turning point in the war – and will travel to Notre Dame University in the US after Vietnam.
Waging Peace has been curated by Ron Carver, who worked alongside active GIs and servicemen in the anti-war movement from 1968.
For Carver and the GIs involved, telling this story in Vietnam was essential and at the exhibition opening on 19 March the US veterans will meet with their Vietnamese counterparts.

Patriotic duty, then a sense of betrayal
Carver helped in the network of coffeehouses, the beating heart of the anti war-movement, which were casual gathering spaces set up near army bases in the US (an estimated 300 existed across the US). Here, disaffected servicemen and army personnel would share stories of how they had become convinced the invasion was, as Carver described it, “a cruel, terrible thing,”
“A lot of these soldiers felt very angry,” said Carver. “Many of them had volunteered to go into the military thinking it was a patriotic and righteous thing to do, and when they went over there and saw the Vietnamese population did not want us, saw the brutality and the war crimes that our country was committing, they felt very betrayed and were highly, highly motivated to develop resistance.”

It was not just conversation that came out of these coffeehouses. They were the hubs of the underground newspapers that proliferated during the war, filled with firsthand accounts from GIs of brutality from the frontline and telling a truth the government and the military tried to suppress. It was often a DIY operation by the GIs who would put the newspapers together by hand and then photocopy them.
They form a focal part of the exhibition. It is thought there were more than 5,000 underground newspapers at the height of the anti-war movement. In San Francisco, The Ally newspaper, which came out monthly, printed up to 20,000 copies each time, and they shipped batches of 100 to the soldiers in Vietnam, where they were a core part of the discord that erupted across military bases.

The military fought back against the coffeehouses as best it could, using police to shut down them down and punishing GIs if they were found in possession of newspapers. They were even investigated by the FBI and, in Fort Dix, the coffeehouse was bombed by vigilantes.
Yet the army came down heaviest on those whose anti-war statements were made in public defiance of orders. Among those honoured by the exhibition are the “Fort Hood Three”, a trio of soldiers who were drafted and trained but refused to report for duty in 1966. It landed them with a court martial and a three-year jail sentence, but as newspapers and posters in the exhibition reveal, they were also made into martyrs by the GI anti-war movement.
“ I really began to identify with the struggle of the Vietnamese people and I began to admire them,” said JJ Johnson, one of the Fort Hood 3. “And the strength to resist grew from the knowledge. I realised, ‘to hell with them, I can’t take part in this.’ And we wanted to say it publicly so people knew this was a feeling that exists within the military.”
The exhibition acknowledges that not all the sacrifices were purely public. Chuck Searcy, who worked with Carver on the exhibition, spent a year in military intelligence in Saigon in 1968 and came back vehemently against the war. He began to speak out, but was subsequently disowned by his father, a former World War Two veteran, and estranged from his family for two years.
“My parents were dismayed,” he said. “It was embarrassing to them. I remember my father said ‘you’re not a good American, you’re not a patriot any more.’ He said to me, ‘what happened to you over there, did they turn you into a communist?’ So many families went through that.”

Schnall, Johnson and Searcy all agreed that despite the multitudes of books and documentaries on Vietnam, the role that GIs played in fighting for peace from within has always been downplayed and overlooked.
“People need to know that active duty soldiers at the height of the Vietnam war, in the belly of the beast, the belly of the green machine, were able to build a movement that ended up crippling the ground forces and stopped them being effective,” added Carver. “That should be an inspiration to people, and that’s what it’s all about.”",LEFT

President Trump vowed he would put “America First” in world affairs, but much of what he did rocked the world's boat and left the U.S. more alone.
The U.S. ""is less admired, less respected and less feared than it needs to be, given how consequential a power we are,"" said Aaron David Miller, a Middle East adviser to former Republican and Democratic presidents.
Miller credits Trump with speeding up the dismantling of the Islamic State's caliphate in Iraq and Syria, as well as preventing new wars. ""There are fewer Americans dying in these conflicts,"" said Miller, now at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
Miller and other analysts assessed Trump's achievements elsewhere around the globe as muddled to harmful.

• Pulled out of international trade agreements
On his first official workday in office last year on Jan. 23, Trump pulled the U.S. out of a major trade pact negotiated by President Barack Obama with 11countries that border the Pacific Ocean, calling his move ""a great thing for the American worker."" The other nations vowed to push ahead on the agreement without the U.S.
The same day, the White House said Trump would renegotiate the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada to stop U.S. companies from moving plants to its neighbors — particularly Mexico — and eliminating American jobs. If a new accord could not be reached that is fairer to American workers and reduces the U.S. trade deficit, Trump said he would withdraw from the deal. The U.S. neighbors have resisted major changes, and the talks continue.
Both gestures were disastrous for U.S. trade and influence, said Anders Aslund, an economist at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, which promotes trans-Atlantic relations.
He said the U.S. marginalized itself from Mexico, a key partner in both trade deals. ""It also means the U.S. isolates itself from Latin America,"" Aslund added.
The agreement with Pacific countries was supposed to set standards for trade, labor and the environment for East Asia under U.S. leadership. By pulling out, Trump in effect allows China to set those standards, Aslund said.
Trump pledged to negotiate better agreements with each country involved, but ""there are no bilateral trade deals being discussed with the United States,"" Aslund said.

• Imposed travel ban
In his first week in office, Trump issued a travel ban on people from eight countries, including six that have Muslim-majority populations. Federal courts blocked the ban, the list of countries changed, and the Supreme Court approved the latest version, which affects Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Chad, while legal challenges continue.
The ban has been decried by other countries around the world.
He also promised to build a wall along the southern U.S. border to keep out illegal immigrants and said Mexico would pay for it. Trump's chief of staff, John Kelly, told Democratic lawmakers this week that Mexico will not pay for the wall, though Trump continues to insist it will.
The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it. Parts will be, of necessity, see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains, wastelands or tough rivers or water..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2018
....The Wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. The $20 billion dollar Wall is “peanuts” compared to what Mexico makes from the U.S. NAFTA is a bad joke! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2018
The immigration issue blew up again last week when reports surfaced that Trump referred to Haiti and countries in Africa as ""shithole countries"" during a meeting with lawmakers in the Oval Office. At least five African countries and the African Union made formal diplomatic protests.
The president's gaffs could make it difficult for some countries to cooperate with the U.S. on such priorities as counterterrorism, said Daniel Fried, a former assistant secretary of State. ""It may not have an effect immediately or today or tomorrow, but it’s going to accumulate,"" he said.

• Battled NATO over money
In his first meeting with NATO allies in May, Trump scolded their “chronic underfunding” of the alliance and refused to explicitly endorse the mutual defense clause of the treaty, known as Article 5. In June, Trump affirmed the U.S. commitment to aid any of the 28 NATO nations if attacked. He did so after other NATO leaders said they were prepared to maintain a collective self-defense even without American support.
But the damage was done, Aslund said: ""Even when Trump eventually came out in favor of Article 5 he does not look like a reliable ally.""
Despite that, Aslund said, Trump did more than the Obama administration to counter Russia's threat to NATO's eastern flank.
Trump reluctantly signed legislation last summer giving Congress sole authority over lifting the sanctions on Russia for its support of separatists in eastern Ukraine. Trump put troops in the Baltics to counter the Russian threat. And he agreed for the first time on Dec. 22 to sell lethal weapons to Ukraine.

• Pulled out of Paris climate accord
Trump ordered the government in June to stop implementing the Obama-era Paris climate agreement, which called for the U.S. and other nations to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. Trump, who has disputed a scientific consensus that human activity is causing higher temperatures, said he would be willing to renegotiate a deal ""that's more fair"" to the United States. Trump's actions, making the U.S. the lone holdout from the global accord, drew international condemnations from American allies in Europe, who ruled out new talks.
Since the Paris agreement was negotiated with Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Europe ""now has to deal with China on its own, and the U.S. has no influence,"" Aslund said.

• Threatened nuclear war with North Korea
Trump used incendiary threats about war with North Korea in August that departed from the more restrained language other presidents have used and sparked international fears of a catastrophic conflict. After North Korea said it would fire missiles in the direction of Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific, Trump responded that ""North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” North Korea never followed through on its threat. Trump also traded unprecedented personal insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump called Kim “little rocket man"" and “a sick puppy.” Kim called Trump ""a dotard,” meaning senile.

North Korea has said it will not relinquish its nuclear weapons capability, which the reclusive country claims was developed to deter a U.S. attack.
Trump boosted international pressure and attention on North Korea, but his goal of removing nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula ""is unrealistic and unrealizable,"" Miller said. And trading insults with Kim ""increases the chance of miscalculation.""

• Repudiated the Iran nuclear deal
Trump last week issued an ultimatum to European allies to fix ""disastrous flaws"" in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal or the U.S. will withdraw. His warning Friday came as he extended waivers of key economic sanctions on Iran, saying this would be the last extension.
The move keeps the deal alive for several months, despite Trump's past vows to scuttle the Iran agreement with the U.S. and five other world powers.
Trump wants Britain, France and Germany to agree to additional restraints on Iran's ballistic missiles, inspections of suspected nuclear sites and permanent restrictions on Iran's ability to secretly produce a nuclear bomb.
More: Iran deal survives for now; Trump will waive sanctions
The accord lifted international sanctions on Iran in return for limits on Iran’s nuclear program. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif accused Trump of trying ""to undermine a solid multilateral agreement.""
Danielle Pletka, a Middle East analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, said many analysts and lawmakers agree with Trump that the Iran deal is flawed. ""If he can leverage a better deal, that’s all for the good."" Pletka said.
But Miller said the risk is considerable. ""If Trump’s approach results in no deal — and we walk — is that a success? I would argue probably not,"" he said.
• Recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital
Trump’s formal recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in December angered Muslim nations and drew a rebuke at the United Nations from 128 countries. Only seven small nations joined the U.S. and Israel in voting against the U.N. resolution Dec. 21, while 35 nations abstained.
Trump said his decision should have no bearing on final borders to be negotiated as part of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
On Tuesday, the Trump administration withheld $65 million, more than half the amount due, from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which has supported Palestinian refugees since the 1948 Arab war that erupted when Israel was created. The Trump administration called for a ""fundamental re-examination"" of the agency.
Pletka said tepid reaction in the Middle East to Trump's decisions showed that support for Palestinians ""has dropped with Arab states that once supported them unreservedly.""

87227,Fox News,2 centuries-old ships discovered at Alexandria's waterfront,"Archaeologists in Alexandria, Va., have uncovered the remains of two ships that likely date back to the late 1700s or 1800s during construction work on the city’s waterfront.
The city announced the discovery at the construction site in the historic Old Town district earlier this week. The find was made at the site of the former Robinson Terminal South. In 2015 a Revolutionary War-era ship was found nearby during construction work for the Hotel Indigo.
“The discovery of three historic ships in a two-block area is absolutely incredible,” said Eleanor Breen, Alexandria’s acting city archaeologist, in a statement. “There have been very few ships from this era excavated in Virginia or nationwide.”
REVOLUTIONARY WAR-ERA SHIP UNEARTHED AT VIRGINIA CONSTRUCTION SITE
The discovery was made last week by experts from Thunderbird Archaeology working for developers JBG Smith and EYA, the Washington Post reports. The site is being developed into a residential complex.
The city is overseeing an analysis of the site to determine what the next steps should be. “As part of a private construction site, the artifacts are not currently open to public view and are not visible from the street,” it said, in its statement.
The ships are the latest historic vessels to be discovered in the U.S. Earlier this year, for example, it was revealed that the wreckage of the Clotilda, the last slave ship to bring slaves to the U.S., may have been found near Mobile, AL.
THE LAST AMERICAN SLAVE SHIP MAY HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED
In 2015 the remains of a Confederate warship were raised from the Savannah River in Georgia. The following year the wreck of a large iron-hulled Civil War-era steamer was discovered off the coast of North Carolina. The ship, which was found off Oak Island, N.C, was tentatively identified as the blockade runner Agnes E. Fry.

81250,The Guardian,Boris Johnson’s miasma of evasion is straight out of the Putin playbook,"In the swirl of disinformation that infects global politics, it is good to hold on to the truth, to ground ourselves slightly. This is a story we tell ourselves. There are places where no one bothers to differentiate between truth and lies; other places. Such as Russia, where there is the facade of a democratic election, but what matters is simply control of the narrative. We watch as various Russian diplomats deny any Russian connection to the poisoning of the Sergei Skripal and his daughter. We look at the US, where they have lost count of Donald Trump’s untruths. He lies as he breathes; the effect is numbing. He has told so many lies that the latest ones float by.
This incessant lying wears the public down. Some Russians claim the lies that are told require a person to split into different realities, so each thing is true at the time. There is no objective truth, only versions of it. The manufacture of chaos is implicit in this deliberate destabilisation. We can locate lying within the pathology of individuals, but it requires ongoing turmoil to sustain it. Trump knows this.
Yet this creation of pandemonium to disguise dishonesty is something we too are familiar with in the burble of Boris Johnson, foreign secretary. The evasions, the metaphors, the spluttering, the wit is, to use a Johnsonian word, a miasma – a fog to hide mendacity. Johnson is a man who has been elevated rather than held accountable for his lies. Some are big: the famed £350m a week after Brexit that we will get back. (Lying about Brussels made his name as a hack.) Some are small – if extramarital affairs and children can be described in this way. It is still astonishing to me that a man of so little credibility represents our country abroad – and especially now. Over the weekend he admitted, in a BBC interview, that he had played a tennis match in 2014 with Lubov Chernukhin, wife of Vladimir Putin’s former deputy finance minister, in return for a £160,000 donation to the Conservative party. It was a matter for the authorities not him, Johnson said, “if there is evidence of gross corruption in the way [Chernukhin] obtained his wealth”. The Tory party is relaxed about donations from oligarchs and it is obvious that Johnson is more relaxed than most, although he seemed somewhat tense defending this. Perhaps because it surely makes his position asking for a unified stance on Russia more difficult.
Hypocrisy, though, is the least of it. Johnson just doesn’t “do” accountability. Why should he, when he simply gets promoted out of culpability?
This month he was questioned about possible misconduct in public office because £46m has been spent on something that did not happen: the garden bridge. How was such a huge sum of money spent? How in 2016 was funding for construction released even though the original conditions for that money had not been met? Johnson as mayor watered down these conditions. Labour and the Lib Dems are rightly asking questions about this. Johnson said the explanation “is something which, I’m afraid, I simply don’t have, at this distance in time”. In what world is this good enough? Lawyers say a charge of public misconduct could follow if Johnson’s actions showed “reckless indifference”. A causal observer may say that this is surely Johnson’s modus operandi.
How is it that someone in power can lie and cheat, we may wonder. How is fake news spread? How is disinformation used? Lying becomes simply an exercise of power. Consequences are for small people. Politics becomes simply a scripted reality show with characters. This is said of Russia, but watching Johnson, maybe these things are not so foreign to us after all.
Is it time to admit privacy is finished?
In another life, I would not use social media. I would write long and thoughtful letters and attend polite debates. I would not get moth killer delivered by Amazon. I would never take an Uber. I would live up a tree.
In this brave not particularly new world, though, all these things are linked, and I am linked through them. I may extricate myself from Facebook following the new revelations, but part of me thinks it is all too late. While, politically, of course I don’t want the engineering of elections based on the exchange of Facebook profiles, I can’t say that this feeling of being watched is novel. Or as individual that I know how to react. Once supermarkets introduced reward cards in the mid-90s, I was aware that my purchases were being tracked, but I shrugged my shoulders. It became ever more noticeable with social media that what was being advertised to me were things I had already bought. There is still this peculiar glitch in the algorithm whereby if you buy one toaster it is presumed you want another. You don’t.
The cluminess of such ads acted as a reassurance. Lately, though, there is the listening by phones, and this does feel like an invasion of privacy. Many people do still want to share pictures of their cat and baby, but there is somehow a dull acceptance that the idea of privacy is now as revolutionary and far off as the world wide web once was. Only disconnect.

The cat in the hat furore – over whether the BBC photoshopped Jeremy Corbyn’s “Lenin cap” to look more “red” in front of a Kremlin backdrop on Newsnight – is one rum do.

There may be something to this, but the gnashing of teeth from his followers did not do anything but make them look cultish and obsessive as two people lay critically ill in hospital. The idea that, until we saw him in that hat, we had no idea of his geopolitical persuasions is as strange as the idea that we have never before seen any imagery that attached him to communist propaganda.

102278,USA Today,Cuba will soon be without a Castro as leader for 1st time in 59 years,"CLOSE Cubans face impending change on their island after elections. Newslook
Cuba is expected to name a new president April 19, 2018, which would mark the first time a Castro is not head of state in nearly 60 years. In this 2011 file photo, former president Fidel Castro, left, and his brother, President Raúl Castro, attend the 6th Congress of the Cuban Communist Party in Havana. (Photo: Javier Galeano, AP)
If all goes as expected, Cuba will name a new president in two weeks — the first time in nearly 60 years that the communist country's leader won't be a Castro.
Outgoing President Raúl Castro will still loom large in retirement, much like his older brother Fidel Castro, who hovered over the nation's affairs in the years leading up to his death in 2016. But when the Cuban National Assembly meets April 19 to name the new president, it will mark a major shift in the history of the Caribbean island that has antagonized and tantalized Americans for decades.
""This is not a transition to democracy, but this is enormous,"" said Pedro Freyre, an attorney with the Akerman law firm who represents several American companies doing business in Cuba. ""As our president would say, 'It's huge.' ""
Castro's successor likely will be a man largely unknown outside Cuba: Miguel Díaz-Canel, 57, who has risen steadily through the ranks of the Communist Party of Cuba. His selection would represent a symbolic change for a regime mostly led by the bearded guerrillas who fought alongside the Castros during the 1959 revolution that overthrew the government of Fulgencio Batista.
Díaz-Canel's ascension to the presidency is not a guarantee. Would-be successors have come and gone over the years. And there is always the possibility Castro chooses someone from the same generation as the Castro brothers and fellow revolutionary Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara.
It also has become more difficult to assess the political situation in Cuba after the U.S. pulled most of its diplomats off the island. President Trump ordered a sharp drawdown at the U.S. Embassy in Havana after a series of mysterious ""health attacks"" against employees there.
Still, Cuba experts agree Castro probably will stand by Díaz-Canel.
Castro and his revolutionary cohorts could be making a pragmatic decision to anoint a younger leader at least to give the appearance the regime is changing with the times, said Frank Mora, director of the Kimberly Green Latin American and Caribbean Center at Florida International University.
""They're all in their late 80s,"" he said. ""They understand that they have to hand power over to someone who will live longer than a couple of years.""

Experts disagree over how much power Díaz-Canel will truly hold and wonder whether Castro continues to run the show as head of the Communist Party of Cuba.
Mora said Cuba won't be entirely out of Castro's grip until he's dead. ""He's still going to be there in the background, still wearing his four-star military uniform,"" he said.
That role would suit Raúl, since he was always more comfortable operating in anonymity, unlike Fidel who basked in the spotlight, said Jaime Suchlicki, director of the Cuban Studies Institute in Miami.
""Raúl never liked the diplomatic activities, going to the parties,"" Suchlicki said. ""So he's going to put this guy in there and create a facade for the new generation. But Díaz-Canel is not going to have any decision-making power.""
It's possible Castro is ready to hand over the reins and ease into retirement after nearly six decades of helping keep the government intact. He has talked about spending more time in his native Santiago, on the eastern end of the island and isolated from the diplomatic and economic hub of Havana.
Freyre said Castro probably will take a more diminished role, emerging only if the new crop of leaders stray too far from the script or bicker too much among themselves.
""Think of it as a telenovela,"" Freyre said. ""The (father) is about to go. The kids are throwing their weight around, saying 'Papa wanted me to have the hacienda' and another saying 'He wanted me to have the Rolls Royce.'
""Raúl is tired. He's not going to run the show day to day. But if the elbow-throwing gets out of hand, the old guy comes in and says, 'Enough!' ""
Another question facing Díaz-Canel is whether he will be able to control the government ministries filled with Castro supporters.
That includes Cuba's military, officials who manage Cuba's centrally planned economy and legions of provincial leaders who have run things a certain way for decades.
""For being a 'revolutionary government,' they are incredibly conservative,"" Freyre said. ""They're very cautious; they're very careful. This is a government that never rushes into doing anything.""
Díaz-Canel seems fine with that. Experts describe him as a true believer in the Marxist-Leninist ideology that formed the basis of Fidel Castro's government. He supported the marginal changes implemented during the 12 years of Raúl Castro's rule, such as allowing Cubans to buy and sell property for the first time, work privately outside the state-run economy and get slightly expanded access to computers, cellphones and the Internet.
He also has clearly adopted the anti-imperialistic stance of his predecessors. In a speech in October, he blasted the United States for its insistence that Cuba move toward a more democratic government.
""Imperialism can never be trusted, not even a tiny bit, never,” Díaz-Canel said, echoing the words of Guevara on the 50th anniversary of his death.
In the end, the biggest hurdle facing Díaz-Canel could be his ability to win over the public.
Fidel and Raúl Castro could always point to their successful revolution as their claim to power. One can't travel far in Cuba without finding a black-and-white photo of the brothers clawing through the mountains of eastern Cuba and fighting their way toward Havana.
Diaz-Canel ""doesn't have those bona fides. He doesn't have that credibility that the first generation of barbudos had,"" Mora said. ""His basis of legitimacy can't be 1959. It has to be, 'What have you done for me lately?' ""

Mrs May spoke to US President Donald Trump about the issue before the US Commerce Department decided to impose near 300% import tariffs on Bombardier's C-Series aircraft in December.
It followed a complaint from rival Boeing about UK and Canadian aid to Bombardier.
The US International Trade Commission is due to make a final decision in the case by the end of this month.
But Mr Harrington told MPs on the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee: ""My expectation is things will not be very different from what has already been determined.""

There have been fears the outcome could impact on jobs at Bombardier in Belfast, where 1,000 workers make wings for the C-Series.
The government, which is backing Bombardier in the dispute, could appeal the final outcome to the World Trade Organisation, but cases can take years to resolve.
Mr Harrington said he believed the entire Boeing case was ""spurious"", adding: ""It is a complete try-on for their own anti-competitive purposes.""
In evidence last year, Boeing told the committee that Bombardier had been found ""to have violated trade law"" in a sale to the US airline, Delta.

58245,NPR,Supreme Court Ruling Means Immigrants Could Continue To Be Detained Indefinitely,"Supreme Court Ruling Means Immigrants Could Continue To Be Detained Indefinitely

Updated at 5:27 p.m. ET
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that immigrants, even those with permanent legal status and asylum seekers, do not have the right to periodic bond hearings.
It's a profound loss for those immigrants appealing what are sometimes indefinite detentions by the government. Many are held for long periods of time — on average, 13 months — after being picked up for things as minor as joyriding. Some are held even longer.
The case, Jennings v. Rodriguez, has implications for legal permanent residents whom the government wants to deport because they committed crimes and for asylum seekers who are awaiting a court date after turning themselves in at the border. Immigrant advocates contend that many of these immigrants have a right to be free on bail until their case is heard.
But the court wrote in its 5-3 opinion Tuesday, ""Immigration officials are authorized to detain certain aliens in the course of immigration proceedings while they determine whether those aliens may be lawfully present in the country.""
The majority opinion was penned by Justice Samuel Alito and joined by the court's conservatives. (Justice Elena Kagan did not participate. She recused herself, stemming from work she had done as former President Barack Obama's solicitor general.)
The decision reversed a Ninth Circuit ruling, but this is not the last word and could come back to the high court.
The Supreme Court sent the case the back to the lower court with two questions unresolved. First, whether indefinite detention without a chance for bail is unconstitutional. Second, whether the challenge to that no-bail provision can be brought as a class action, instead of as individual cases.
Stanford Law professor Lucas Guttentag says that in practical terms, the class action question is enormously important because most of the immigrants affected by Tuesday's decision don't have lawyers.
""If they're required to proceed individually, many of them will never be able to pursue their claims,"" he says. ""A class action provides protection to everyone, not just to those who have a lawyer who can file a lawsuit.""
No one can claim, nor since the time of slavery has anyone to my knowledge successfully claimed, that persons held within the United States are totally without constitutional protection.
On Tuesday, Justice Stephen G. Breyer read from his dissent, a rare move for the court and an indication of just how passionately he disagrees with the majority opinion.
""We need only recall the words of the Declaration of Independence,"" Breyer said, ""in particular its insistence that all men and women have 'certain unalienable Rights,' and that among them is the right to 'Liberty.' ""
He continued, calling the ruling ""legal fiction.""
""Whatever the fiction, would the Constitution leave the Government free to starve, beat, or lash those held within our boundaries?"" Breyer argued. ""If not, then, whatever the fiction, how can the Constitution authorize the Government to imprison arbitrarily those who, whatever we might pretend, are in reality right here in the United States?""
Breyer added, ""No one can claim, nor since the time of slavery has anyone to my knowledge successfully claimed, that persons held within the United States are totally without constitutional protection.""
The lead plaintiff in the case is a legal permanent resident, Alejandro Rodriguez, who came to the U.S. as a child and worked as a dental assistant. As a teenager, he was convicted for joyriding, and at 24, he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance.
Rodriguez was detained for three years without the right to appear before a judge to ask for bond.
The American Civil Liberties Union took up Rodriguez's case. The civil rights group filed a class action lawsuit and eventually won his release and the cancellation of his deportation order. Rodriguez remains in the United States.
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the immigrant detainees and asylum seekers can't be detained indefinitely and that they have a right to a bond hearing every six months. The appellate court also held that in order to hold these detainees, the government must show that the immigrants would pose a danger or become a flight risk if set free.
The Obama administration appealed to the high court, insisting that Congress — not the courts — has the power to make immigration law and that the law allows the government to detain ""criminal and terrorist aliens"" as well as ""aliens seeking admission to the United States.""
The Trump administration continued the case.
The administration also argued that detained immigrants should not be recognized as a class that could bring legal action. Lawyers for the Justice Department said detainees should rely on individual habeas corpus petitions to challenge their detentions.
The ACLU countered that few detainees have access to legal counsel and that a backlog of such habeas corpus petitions almost guarantees delays in winning release.",LEFT

Police said the teen was brought to the hospital in critical condition and was eventually “downgraded to extremely critical.”
Lackland reportedly did not have a carry permit for the weapon.
A witness on the scene recalled hearing the gun go off and said Lackland was emotional, Fox 19 reported.

Lackland was arrested and charged with aggravated assault, reckless endangerment and unlawful possession of a weapon, police said.
Challenge-type games have long been fueled by internet exposure. One of the most recent and more highly publicized has been the Tide pod challenge.

According to The Washington Post, last year U.S. poison control centers received reports of more than 10,500 children younger than 5 who were exposed to the capsules. The same year, nearly 220 teens were reportedly exposed, and about 25 percent of those cases were intentional, the paper said, citing data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers.

North Korea surprised Seoul with a message around midnight that it intends to postpone indefinitely high-level talks that were scheduled for today.
South Korea's Defense Ministry responded by saying the Max Thunder training would continue as scheduled, while the Unification Ministry said in a statement the North's message was ""regrettable.""

With its latest announcement, North Korea ""has again shot itself in the foot, this time on the cusp of a historic meeting with the U.S. president which could have ended the Korean War and eased its diplomatic isolation,” senior research fellow Bruce Klinger of the Heritage Foundation said today at a forum at the Asian Leadership Conference in Seoul.
""North Korea returned to acting like the belligerent regime of six months ago by canceling an inter-Korean meeting planned for today and threatening to suspend its summit with President Trump,"" Klinger added. ""Pyongyang knew of the long-planned U.S.-South Korean military exercises that it cites as justification for its abrupt actions. Indeed, Kim Jong Un had dismissed the exercises as a concern during his meeting with a senior South Korean delegation in February.
""North Korea is back to its old game of trying to raise the stakes prior to a meeting. But Kim risks undermining the goodwill he had built up through his diplomatic outreach since January.""
North Korea earlier threatened to pull out of a planned summit with the United States if Trump or officials demanded a ""unilateral"" abandonment of its nuclear arsenal, driving Kim Jong Un's nation ""into a corner.""

""The U.S. is miscalculating the magnanimity and broad-minded initiatives of the DPRK as signs of weakness and trying to embellish and advertise as if these are the product of its sanctions and pressure,"" Kim Kye Gwan, North Korea's first vice minister for foreign affairs and former nuclear-program negotiator, said.
Kim Kye Gwan accused ""high-ranking officials of the White House and the Department of State"" of ""provoking"" them with ""unbridled remarks.""
He also took aim at John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser.
Bolton recently said the administration is considering a roadmap for North Korea similar to Libya.
""The implementation of the decision means getting rid of all the nuclear weapons, dismantling them, taking them to Oak Ridge, Tennessee,"" Bolton said Sunday on ABC News' ""This Week."" ""It means getting rid of the uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing capabilities.""
North Korea's statement was ""very aggressive"" -- too aggressive to be regarded as ""just a symbolic gesture or just a hint to the U.S. saying you guys need to slow down,"" Sue Mi Terry, a senior fellow and Korea chair at the Center for Strategic International Studies, said.

“If this is a calculation by Kim Jong Un to gain leverage in the upcoming talks with President Trump,"" Terry said today at the leadership conference in Seoul. ""I think he might be miscalculating pouring cold water.""
Analysts who track North Korea said the nation was sensitive to the Libya comparison, especially after what happened to that country's deposed leadership.
Bolton has previously said it would be ""perfectly legitimate"" to carry out a preemptive strike on North Korea. His appointment in March raised concerns among those in favor of reconciliation.
The North Koreans also appear sensitive to recent comments by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about economic opportunities available to the North if they denuclearize, according to Jung H. Pak, the SK-Korea Foundation Chair in Korea Studies and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
""They are annoyed and irritated about the supposed carrot that we're throwing out there they didn’t even ask for,"" Pak said today at the leadership conference in Seoul. ""It portrays them as a supplicant rather than equal negotiating partner that they want.""
Still, this sudden turn by Pyongyang, especially after Kim Jong Un just stepped foot in South Korea, shows the North's frustration at U.S. posturing and the ongoing military drills.

The North had no choice but to put a stop to the inter-Korean high-level talks, blaming that South, which is ""completely responsible"" for ""playing around in madness"" when relations potentially had been heading toward peace, according to North Korean state news agency KCNA.
The South's Unification Ministry said in a statement, ""It is regrettable that North unilaterally put off the inter-Korean high-level talks on the grounds of annual air-combat drills,"" adding that it would send a notice to the North today, perhaps to reschedule talks.
It was unclear exactly what message would be included.
Max Thunder is a two-week long annual joint military exercise featuring dozens of U.S. and South Korean aircraft. It was postponed from earlier this year because of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

94153,Reuters,Swiss prosecutors checking if minister payments linked to Rio's Oyu Tolgoi,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss prosecutors on Thursday confirmed they were checking whether “questionable payments” to an ex-Mongolian finance minister were linked to Rio Tinto’s Oyu Tolgoi mining project, adding the Anglo-Australian mining company was “not an accused”.
FILE PHOTO: Mining trucks are seen at the Oyu Tolgoi mine in Mongolia's South Gobi region June 23, 2012. REUTERS/David Stanway/File Photo
Reuters reported last week that the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) was examining whether Rio made illicit payments potentially linked to the copper and gold mine, part of the OAG’s investigation into a seized Swiss bank account used in 2008 to transfer $10 million to Mongolia’s former finance minister, Bayartsogt Sangajav.
Bayartsogt, who has denied wrongdoing, signed the investment deal which granted 66 percent of the giant Gobi desert property to Robert Friedland’s Ivanhoe Mines, now known as Turquoise Hill Resources, and majority owned by Rio Tinto. Mongolia owns the rest.
“According to the current state of the investigation, Rio Tinto is not an accused,” the OAG said in an e-mail to Reuters on Thursday.
“However, inquiries are being made as to whether the questionable payments to a former Mongolian finance minister were factually related to the Oyu Tolgoi mining project or to other mining projects in Mongolia.”
Rio Tinto declined to comment.
Via its Swiss lawyers, Rio Tinto this week inquired about the OAG probe. They were told that “currently, the investigation is directed neither against your client nor against any of your client’s employees,” according to a letter from the OAG obtained by Reuters.
The Mongolian government requested Swiss legal assistance in the case in 2017.
Discussing the origins of the $10 million in Mongolia’s capital Ulaanbaatar last week, Bayartsogt said the payment was not connected to Oyu Tolgoi, saying it was transferred to him by an investor to support a business he had established.
He declined to name the investor.
Swiss prosecutors seized two accounts containing about $1.85 million at a Swiss bank in 2016. Switzerland’s highest court this month rejected the unidentified account holder’s bid to unblock them.
Mongolia’s anti-corruption authority has told Reuters that it is investigating a number of cases involving Bayartsogt.
The agency is also investigating the country’s 2009 investment pact with Rio Tinto which kickstarted the massive project.",CENTER
99862,Politico,DNC official quits after uproar over ‘colored people’ remarks,"John Parker, the Duval County Democratic state committeeman, had told party officials he would post his resignation on his Facebook page. | Flickr DNC official quits after uproar over ‘colored people’ remarks
MIAMI — A Florida Democratic National Committee member who offended African-Americans for using the phrase “colored people” resigned his office Wednesday as the state party chairwoman and other officials called on him to quit — echoing the comments of his own wife, the Democratic Party chair in Duval County.
“I misspoke and used language that was hurtful. I apologized and pledged that I would learn from my mistake,” John Parker said in a letter to local, state and national officials that tendered his resignation as the Duval County Democratic state committeeman and as a DNC member from Florida.
Story Continued Below
“I understand my error perpetuates divisiveness and does not allow us an opportunity for the important types of meaningful discourse — a conversation our party must engage in sooner rather than later — that help us grow as individuals and a party protecting the dignity of all people,” he wrote.
Parker had said he meant to say “people of color” instead of “colored people” and eventually apologized for his offhanded remarks Jan. 22 after a local Democratic Party meeting in Jacksonville, Fla.
“I am confident that a full investigation would have shown that I erred with my mouth, not my heart,” Parker wrote, explaining he was resigning for the good of the party.
Parker denied other accusations that he used more racially charged language. As he resisted calls to step down, some felt their complaints were being ignored in the ensuing months.
That led to increased media scrutiny and the remarkable call by Parker’s wife, Duval County Democratic Executive Committee Chairwoman Lisa King, to say Monday that he should quit. After POLITICO published a story Wednesday on the controversy, Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo broke months of silence and said he needed to go.
“Along with DEC Chair Lisa King, I also asked John Parker to resign. I believe him stepping down is the right thing to do,” Rizzo said in a statement to POLITICO.
Though some Democrats felt the new chairwoman had done enough, insiders say she had held private conversations with surrogates to try to get Parker to leave his position. But he stayed on, troubling party officials who worried about the increasing racial tensions in Duval County, a key Florida battleground where the party is counting on strong black turnout in November if Gov. Rick Scott challenges Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and if Democrats are to win the governor’s mansion for the first time in 20 years.
On Wednesday morning, Democratic gubernatorial candidate and former Rep. Gwen Graham called Parker — who had endorsed her — and asked him to quit and then publicly called on him to resign.
""I am very concerned about this situation,” Graham said. “We need to bring Democrats together in 2018, not create distractions and divisions through our words and actions. I urge Mr. Parker to apologize fully and resign his positions as Duval County Democratic State Committeeman and on the Democratic National Committee.""
Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, the only African American gubernatorial candidate, joined with Graham in calling on Parker to quit as did one of Parker’s top African-American allies, state Sen. Audrey Gibson of Jacksonville.
“While I do not believe John had any intent of malice in the manner in which he spoke, it is imperative that for the good of this city and the local and statewide party that he take this action,” Gibson said in a written statement Wednesday.
But another top Democratic official from the county, state Rep. Kimberly Daniels (D-Jacksonville), expressed more outrage and was the first elected official to call on him to quit. She also said Parker’s wife should step down as well because she showed “complicity” in not calling on him to resign until media pressure mounted.
But as he stalled, Democrats began breaking their silence.
Daniels also leveled other more serious charges about Parker’s alleged use of racial language, including “disgraceful comments about integration.”
“Preceding this instance, he allegedly referred to the Working People Caucus as the ‘Poor Black People Working Caucus' and called a constituent the 'mayor’s mammy,'"" Daniels wrote in a press statement Monday night. “Unlike, other leaders in Florida, even after a request from the Florida Black Caucus, Mr. Parker has not resigned.”
When Parker finally quit, he acknowledged his errors.
“I take responsibility for my mistake and as such is the impetus of my decision,” he said. “I resign for the good of my Party and all those who are fighting so hard for a better world than the one we are in now.”",UNDEFINED

The 20-page letter from Trump attorney Jay Sekulow and then-Trump lawyer John Dowd was a response about a possible interview at the end of January that never came to pass. Trump's lawyers disagreed about whether to do the interview, and the team ended up formally responding on January 29 with the letter, which included materials from documents the special counsel already had in its possession and contained constitutional objections to requiring the President's testimony, CNN reported, citing sources briefed on discussions. According to one source, Trump reviewed the letter and approved it.
The letter from Trump's team threw a wrench into the discussions until early March, CNN reported. There were then two more meetings with the special counsel's team on March 5 and March 12. At the March 5 session, according to one of the sources, Mueller made the case that only Trump himself can talk about what his intent was regarding certain actions he took after assuming the presidency, which remains the Mueller team's position.

131071,Fox News,Hillary Clinton gears up to influence midterms -- whether Dems like it or not,"Hillary Clinton has ramped up her efforts to influence the Democratic Party and its voters in upcoming midterm elections, a move that some say only hands ammunition to Republican candidates.
Many thought Clinton's 2016 presidential election defeat -- which followed a failed 2008 primary campaign -- would end her political life. But the subsequent tour for the book ""What Happened"" has helped keep the former U.S. secretary of state visible despite her devastating loss to Donald Trump.
On Monday, Clinton activated her political machine, attending a gathering of nearly a dozen progressive groups supported by Onward Together, the post-election political organization she founded that's aimed at “advancing the progressive vision that earned nearly 66 million votes in the last election.”
""So I feel as strongly today as I ever have that we all have to stand up and defend our country, and most importantly, our democracy.” - Hillary Clinton
“I don’t want to see us go backwards,” Clinton told Bustle. “But organized interests fueled by ideology and huge amounts of money are trying to take us backwards. So I feel as strongly today as I ever have that we all have to stand up and defend our country, and most importantly, our democracy.”
The Clinton family also plans to restart fundraising efforts for the Clinton Foundation, which is being investigated for “pay to play” politics while Clinton headed the State Department (2009-13), inviting people to a benefit event on May 24 in New York, according to Axios. The price for attending ranges from $2,500 for a cocktail party and dinner – up to $100,000 for a special reception.
Her return to political life comes ahead of midterm elections this November, where energized Democratic voters hope to take back some control in Washington, D.C., following nearly two years of the contentious Trump presidency.
“Just as I’m working here today to try to make sure we’re prepared to do everything we can in November, there are thousands of people on the other side who are doing the same,” Clinton told Bustle. “Even though I think the energy is on our side, we have to translate that into a very strong electoral strategy.”
Clinton’s political organization boasts of giving over $1 million in grants in its first year to left-wing groups. The disclosed financial records show the organization raised only $115,000 in the last year, but because it’s registered as a nonprofit social welfare organization, the actual money raised and the identities of the donors do not have to be disclosed.
Among the groups that it gave money, according to the outlet, is Indivisible – a group that sent liberal activists to Republican town halls last year.
The Republicans, meanwhile, knowing that Clinton remains the most unpopular high-profile Democrat in the country, second only to House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, have decided to make Clinton a target during the midterm elections.
""We're going to make them own her,"" Republican National Committee spokesman Rick Gorka said.
Remarks by Clinton have already forced some Democrats to disassociate from her. U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., slammed the former candidate for saying that voters in America’s heartland backed Trump for president because they wanted to move the country “backward.”
""For those of us that are in states that Trump won, we would really appreciate if she would be more careful and show respect to every American voter and not just the ones who voted for her,"" McCaskill said.
In North Dakota, Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who faces a tough re-election fight in November, was asked in March in a radio interview when Clinton would “ride off into the sunset.”
“Not soon enough,” Heitkamp responded.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Sunday criticized Russia and Iran over the deteriorating conditions in Syria, where people in an enclave near Damascus are caught up in a struggle between rebels and government forces.
""The United States condemns the ongoing military offensive that the Assad regime, backed by Russia and Iran, is perpetrating against the people of Eastern Ghouta,"" Sanders said in a statement.

President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May spoke about the situation on Sunday, May's office said, adding that the two leaders agreed the situation is a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" for which blame rests with Syria and Russia.
""They agreed that Russia and others with influence over the Syrian regime must act now to cease their campaign of violence and to protect civilians,"" the British readout said.
According to a Reuters report, Eastern Ghouta is one of the few rebel-controlled areas remaining as the nation's brutal civil war drags on. Russia is the primary backer of Syrian President Bashar Assad. The U.S. has backed military forces in the country, but their primary purpose is to fight the Islamic State. On rare occasions, U.S.-led forces have fought Assad-backed fighters in self-defense.
Sanders mentioned a United Nations Security Council resolution from late last month, which passed unanimously and called for a cease-fire across Syria for humanitarian aid and medical evacuations.
""Russia has gone on to ignore its terms and to kill innocent civilians under the false auspices of counterterrorism operations,"" Sanders said. ""This is the same combination of lies and indiscriminate force that Russia and the Syrian regime used to isolate and destroy Aleppo in 2016, where thousands of civilians were killed.""",UNDEFINED

The group hopes it moves Americans to vote against Republicans in the midterm elections.
The ad from Progressive Change Campaign Committee features the audio ProPublica published of young kids wailing for their “mamá” and “papá” after having been separated from them at the border as a result of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy.
“This is Trump’s America. Is it yours?” the ad concludes. “Remember in November.”
Starting Friday, the ads will air on MSNBC, CNN and Fox in the Washington, D.C., area, the group’s press secretary, Marissa Barrow, told HuffPost by email.
After more fundraising, the group hopes to expand the ads to “key congressional districts” across the country ― including in California, Nebraska and Kansas, where Republican lawmakers are “supporting Trump’s agenda” on immigration, the group told Mic.
The ad aims to hold President Donald Trump and “the Republicans who enable his racist policies accountable,” Barrow said, noting that it was timed to capitalize on the “public energy” around the family separations and ensure midterm voters don’t forget the sounds of children taken from their parents.
The ads come after days of nationwide outrage reached a fever pitch over the “zero tolerance” policy that refers for criminal prosecution all migrants crossing the border illegally and has led to officials separating over 2,300 children from their parents since May.
“Trump’s executive order does nothing to reunite the nearly 2,500 kids who’ve been separated from their parents or guardians and were placed into ‘tender age’ facilities,” Barrow noted.
“The policy itself was not an accident ― it was an intentional 2018 strategy to excite the racist, anti-immigrant portion of his base,” she added.
Another progressive group launched a separate ad campaign this week also featuring the audio ― a seven-figure campaign funded by liberal “megadonor” Tom Steyer, reported CNN. The goal of that ad was also to mobilize voters before the midterms.",LEFT
196828,ABC News,Russian talks with rebels over south Syria collapse,"Negotiations between the Russians and Syrian rebels to end days of violence in the country's south collapsed Saturday after opposition forces rejected surrender conditions proposed by Moscow, a rebel spokesman and a war monitor said.
Shortly after the collapse of negotiations over southern Syria, airstrikes intensified on rebel-held parts of Daraa province that borders Jordan. Saturday's talks came on the heels of similar negotiations which took place Friday, in which the Russians tabled their conditions to halt a Russian-backed government offensive to capture rebel-held areas along the borders with Jordan and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
""The talks collapsed because the Russians insisted on their conditions that want us to surrender,"" said rebel spokesman Ibrahim Jabawi. ""The (rebels') negotiating team refused to surrender and refused to accept the Russian conditions.""
Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, also confirmed that the talks collapsed adding that shortly afterward Syrian and Russian warplanes intensified their airstrikes.
Syrian state media said earlier Saturday that more areas in Daraa province had been captured and in others rebels had agreed to hand over their weapons and reconcile with the government.
The government offensive that began June 19 has killed scores of people, wounded hundreds of others and forced more than 50,000 to flee to areas close to the borders with Jordan and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
Jabawi, spokesman for the rebels' joint operations room, said the insurgents set up a delegation that met with Russian officials Friday and again Saturday. He added that there are currently more efforts to hold a new round of talks to avoid further violence.
Jabawi told The Associated Press that Russia, a strong ally of President Bashar Assad's government, wants the rebels to hand over their weapons followed by a return of government forces to rebel-held areas.
Speaking by telephone from Jordan Jabawi said that the meetings with the Russians took place in an area near where the provinces of Daraa and Sweida meet.
""The Russian conditions are that rebels hand over everything and in return all areas will come under Bashar Assad's control,"" Jabawi said. ""All people who carried arms will be put on trial.""
Jabawi had said earlier Saturday that the Russian conditions ""cannot be accepted"" adding that to pressure the rebels, intense airstrikes have been targeting southern villages and towns that have until now largely evaded the violence of Syria's seven-year conflict.
The Observatory said the negotiations between rebels and the Russians were aimed to find ""a full solution"" for the future of Daraa.
It said negotiations aimed to reach a cease-fire as well as have rebels hand over their heavy weapons then later their light weapons. It added that in return for Russian guarantees, the rebels would hand over the Naseeb border crossing with Jordan and return state institutions to rebel-held areas in the south.
The Russians would also compile lists of rebels' names to work on securing them amnesty with the Syrian government.
The Observatory said that since the offensive began 11 days ago, 116 civilians have been killed including five on Saturday.
Jordanian government spokeswoman Jumana Ghunaimat said Amman is communicating with most of the parties to the Syrian crisis, mainly Russia and the U.S., in an attempt to reach a cease-fire.
""Jordan insists on its position that a political solution must end the Syrian crisis and it deals with relief organizations to help the displaced inside Syria,"" she said late Friday.

20944,NPR,Trump's Unique Concept Of The Presidency Again On Display As Government Shuts Down,"Trump's Unique Concept Of The Presidency Again On Display As Government Shuts Down
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
This hour, we've been tackling two important stories - the federal government shutdown and the anniversary of President Trump's first year in office. So this is where we wanted to take a step back and look at what it all means. We'll start with NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thank you so much for joining us once again.
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Happy to be here.
MARTIN: So what have we heard so far from President Trump since the shutdown started?
LIASSON: What we've heard from President Trump is a pretty simple message - and he said it over and over again on Twitter - Democrats are holding the military hostage over their desire for unchecked illegal immigration. And that's a message that I think his base will find very appealing, whether it helps him with anyone beyond his base is not clear.
MARTIN: And what about the Democrats and what about that argument? I mean, the polls show - and there's been some recent polling on this - it shows that the whole idea of protecting DACA recipients is politically popular but not when you've posed it as a tradeoff between...
LIASSON: Right.
MARTIN: ...You know, keeping the government open and helping them. So what about on the Democratic side?
LIASSON: The problem for both sides is that neither is convinced that the other guy will pay politically. For Democrats, they know, as you said, that something like 90 percent of Americans are sympathetic with their position on the DREAMers but not shutting down the government over the DREAMers. And when people are polled about who would you blame. It turns out that majorities, overall, would blame Republicans for a shutdown. After all, they control all branches of government.
But in those big five states, the red states where Democratic Senate incumbents are running for re-election - and that's what Democrats are most worried about in those states - Missouri, Montana, West Virginia, Indiana, South Dakota - that's where Democrats would be blamed if it looks like they're doing this because of the DREAMers.
And in terms of whether the president would be blamed, we do know that the hashtag @Trumpshutdown, not @Schumershutdown, but @Trumpshutdown was the top trending topic on Twitter on Friday night. So a lot of people voted for him thinking he was a businessman who would come to Washington, make deals, which is what he promised, make the government work. And now here we are on the first anniversary of his inauguration with a shutdown.
MARTIN: Just building on that point, though, you know, in the past, the polls have suggested that Republicans were blamed for the shutdown but then they went on to midterm elections and actually did fine - in fact, did very, very well, according to the historical pattern that says, you know, the party in the White House tends to suffer in midterms, right? So any sense of what's going to happen this year?
LIASSON: Well, this is the first shutdown that we've ever had under one-party control of government. The last shutdown in 2013, of course, there was a Democrat in the White House, Republicans in Congress. And what you're talking about is absolutely true. What happened was Republicans initially were blamed for the shutdown.
The approval ratings for the Republican Party dropped faster and deeper than they had ever dropped before during that shutdown. But then what people forget about is that then the Obamacare website debuted and crashed. And it totally wiped that story of the shutdown off the front pages. And that's what could happen now if we have a very short shutdown. If something happens to wipe this story in our kind of ADD news environment, we might be talking about something completely different a week from now.
MARTIN: Mara, just one more minute on this, if I could, before we head into the Barbershop because I'm going to ask them to reflect on this question. You know, here we are on the one-year anniversary of President Trump's inauguration. What more do we know about him now than we did a year ago?
LIASSON: Wow. Well, I think what we've - what I wondered about when he was inaugurated was, would he be different in degree or kind? Was he just a ruder, cruder kind of conservative Republican or something completely different? I think in terms of domestic policy, he's become a pretty standard conservative Republican - tax cuts, Neil Gorsuch, deregulation.
But I think for - on the other hand, his divisive behavior and his continuing attacks on democratic institutions like the independent judiciary, free press, the FBI - I think that shows us that he conceives of the presidency in a completely different way than any of his predecessors. He doesn't see himself as the moral leader of the country or with the responsibility to unify the country. He has a totally different concept of the presidency.
MARTIN: That's NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thank you.
LIASSON: Thank you.

101815,ABC News,Mueller has evidence raising questions about Prince testimony on meeting with Russian: Sources,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller has obtained evidence that calls into question Congressional testimony given by Trump supporter and Blackwater founder Erik Prince last year, when he described a meeting in Seychelles with a Russian financier close to Vladimir Putin as a casual chance encounter “over a beer,” sources tell ABC News.
Well-connected Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, a key witness given limited immunity by Mueller, has been interviewed seven times by prosecutors on a wide range of subjects. He told investigators that he set up a meeting in the Seychelles between Prince and Russian sovereign wealth fund CEO Kirill Dmitriev, mere days before Trump was inaugurated, sources familiar with the investigation said this week.
Nader has submitted to three interviews with special counsel investigators and four appearances before a federal grand jury in Washington since agents stopped him at Dulles International Airport in January, served him with a grand jury subpoena and seized his electronic devices, including his cell phone. Documents obtained by Mueller suggest that before and after Prince met Nader in New York a week before the trip to the Seychelles, Nader shared information with Prince about Dmitriev, sources familiar with the investigation told ABC News, which appears to be inconsistent with Prince’s sworn testimony before a U.S. House of Representatives investigative panel.
""I didn't fly there to meet any Russian guy,"" Prince told the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in November. He testified that he travelled to the Seychelles for a meeting with United Arab Emirates officials about possible business opportunities, and they introduced him – unexpectedly – to Dmitriev.
As of late March, Mueller’s team has not asked Prince – whose sister Betsy DeVos serves as Trump’s Secretary of Education – to appear before the grand jury being used to investigate whether Trump campaign officials or transition aides colluded with Russian government operatives, according to one of Prince’s friends.

Prince told the House Intelligence Committee that his meeting with Dmitriev was a chance encounter “down in the bar” at the suggestion of ""one of the brothers"" of the United Arab Emirates' leader Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed al-Nayhan.
""At the end, one of the entourage says, 'Hey, by the way, there’s this Russian guy that we’ve dealt with in the past. He’s here also to see someone from the Emirati delegation. And you should meet him. He'd be an interesting guy for you to know, since you’re doing a lot in the oil and gas and mineral space,’” Prince told lawmakers under oath in his sworn testimony. “So, as I recall, I met him, this same guy I talked about, Kirill Dmitriev. Met him down in the bar after dinner, and we talked for 30 minutes over a beer, and that was it.”
Sources say Nader -- who worked at the time for the Emirati leader, known as ""MBZ” – tells a different story. According to multiple sources, the U.A.E., an important U.S. ally increasingly eager to be seen as a global powerbroker, wanted to bring a Russian close to the Kremlin together with someone Nader believed was a trusted confidant of members of the incoming administration.
Sources tell ABC News Nader met with Prince at New York's Pierre Hotel a week before the Jan. 11, 2017 meeting in the Seychelles, and later sent Prince biographical information about Dmitriev, which, according to those sources, noted that Dmitriev had been appointed by Putin to oversee the state-run sovereign wealth fund.
Nader says he then facilitated and personally attended the meetings, including one between Prince and Dmitriev, at a resort owned by MBZ off the coast of East Africa, the sources told ABC News. One of the primary goals of the meeting, Nader told investigators, was to discuss foreign policy and to establish a line of communication between the Russian government and the incoming Trump administration, sources told ABC News.
Nader — who Prince said in a 2010 lawsuit deposition had once represented his military contractor business in Iraq — was not mentioned in Prince's congressional testimony despite Prince being asked by lawmakers who was present. Prince said only that Dmitriev's wife was there but she left after a few minutes while they discussed terrorism and oil prices.
A spokesperson for Prince told ABC News on Thursday that ""Erik has said all there is to say to the committee and has nothing further to add."" Prince has said that the Seychelles meeting was leaked to the news media last year in an illegal “unmasking” of his identity in U.S. signals intelligence intercepts.

Nader, a naturalized U.S. citizen, is an enigma in the nearly yearlong probe of the Trump presidential campaign's dealings with Russians linked to the Kremlin.
His background and credibility have come under attack as his name appeared in recent headlines. He has been arrested twice in the U.S., first in 1984 and again 1991, and convicted once, according to court records unsealed in March, for possession of pornographic videos featuring underage boys. He also reportedly served prison time in the Czech Republic in 2003 for similar crimes.
Nader's lawyers at powerhouse firm Latham & Watkins, which includes former Obama White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, have said unnamed individuals are dredging up the old criminal cases to discredit him as an important witness for Mueller. They declined to comment to ABC News on Nader's interactions with the special counsel and Nader himself has refused to speak about the Russia probe.
Few in Washington remember George Nader, whose colorful biography reads like a spy thriller: his career has spanned the globe, and along the way he has been a hostage negotiator, arms broker, security operative and, now, an important witness for the former director of the FBI.
He’s even negotiated with the Kremlin. According to Al-Monitor, a news website covering the Middle East, Nader helped broker a $4.2 billion arms deal between Iraq and Russia in 2012.
Nader’s associates say he has embarked on countless sensitive diplomatic missions overseas and was once a special adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney. He had easy access to the White House under Presidents Reagan, both Bushes and Clinton, according to former officials, and he visited the Trump White House last year despite his criminal record.
Nader posed with Trump for a picture and even helped arrange the new American president's first major foreign trip to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia last year, two top Trump advisers told ABC News.
""He has worked for the Israelis, the Syrians, the Iranians, the Saudis, the Emiratis, the Shiites in southern Iraq,"" said Mouafac Harb, a Lebanese former journalist who has known Nader for decades. ""He’s typical of the kind of shady operatives you often see in the Middle East.”

His 1991 federal conviction in Alexandria, Virginia, for being caught returning from Germany with videotapes in his luggage ""depicting minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct"" highlights the conflicting chapters in his life.
Prominent foreign policy figures sent testimonials to the federal trial court judge in Virginia, including one friend who said Nader, a Lebanese Christian, ""is risking his life"" to help free a dozen American, British and other hostages held in Beirut in 1991, by leveraging his close ties to the Shi'a terrorist group Hezbollah. The letters to the judge were provided to ABC News last week by Nader's legal team.
The judge in 1991 sentenced Nader to six months in a halfway house -- well below mandatory sentencing guidelines at that time -- and allowed him to travel to both Moscow and Beirut during his criminal proceedings, later citing Nader's ""extraordinary cooperation with the government in certain areas.""
The 1991 criminal case was ordered sealed for six months. Instead, it remained under seal for 26 years, until a judge opened the case file last month amid news reports about Nader cooperating with Mueller. Sources told ABC News the U.S. government did not want Nader's secrets easily unearthed while he operated as a backchannel on sensitive matters.
""We used him because we needed all the channels we could get into the Syrian security establishment,"" said a former top career American diplomat in Damascus, who was aware of Nader's activities in the years following his 1991 conviction. ""Nobody was looking for his child porn case. Nobody cared about that stuff at all back then. He was providing too invaluable a service to us.""
Nader, according to one former diplomat, has a rare and valuable skill.
""His stock in trade is access and influence,” the former diplomat said. “He finds a way to be valuable to people.”
But Nader had dropped off the radar of many former associates two decades ago, including those who worked in Washington for his ""Middle East Insight"" magazine, which held many foreign policy discussions hosted by Nader and televised on C-Span until it folded around the time of his criminal conviction.
""Until his name appeared recently, I had no idea that Mr. Nader was even alive,"" said one former writer at the magazine, who, like most of Nader's associates, declined to be identified by name.",CENTER
62578,HuffPost,Donald Trump Attacks Alec Baldwin In Early Morning Twitter Rant Amid Week Of Chaos,"President Donald Trump took a break from dealing with turmoil in his administration to once again lash out at actor Alec Baldwin in an early-morning Twitter rant.
Earlier this week, Baldwin told The Hollywood Reporter that portraying Trump on “Saturday Night Live” had become “like agony.”
“Anybody over this guy,” said Baldwin. “It doesn’t matter. We have to get rid of him.”
Baldwin’s comments apparently struck a nerve for Trump, whose administration is reeling from a string of setbacks this week, including the departure of one of his closest confidants, Hope Hicks. He’s also under fire for appearing to cave to the NRA just a day after he promised to tackle gun control.
The president responded to Baldwin’s comments with a rambling error-strewn post, in which he twice misspelled the actor’s name, as well as the word “dying.”
Twitter
Trump also urged “SNL” to bring back Darrell Hammond, who portrayed the then-reality star on the show until 2016.
The tweet remained live for around 10 minutes before it was deleted. Trump quickly replaced it with this correctly spelled post:
Alec Baldwin, whose dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me on SNL, now says playing me was agony. Alec, it was agony for those who were forced to watch. Bring back Darrell Hammond, funnier and a far greater talent! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2018
Hammond is yet to respond, but Baldwin hit back first with this tweet:
Agony though it may be, I’d like to hang in there for the impeachment hearings, the resignation speech, the farewell helicopter ride to Mara-A-Lago. You know. The Good Stuff. That we’ve all been waiting for. — ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) March 2, 2018
In a further burn, Baldwin then imagined what Trump’s Presidential Library will look like:
Looking forward to the Trump Presidential Library.
A putting green.
Recipes for chocolate cake.
A live Twitter feed for visitors to post on.
A little black book w the phone numbers of porn stars.
You’re in and out in five minutes.

43200,CBS News,"Trump: ""Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?""","President Trump fired off a tweet Saturday morning, asking, ""Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?"" He said some people's lives ""are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation.""
Mr. Trump didn't mention anyone specific in the tweet, which came after accusations of abuse against two now-former aides.
Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2018
One of those aides is Rob Porter, who resigned this week after his two former wives came forward and accused him of abusing them. On Friday night, The Washington Post first reported another White House aide, David Sorensen, resigned after his ex-wife accused him of abuse, including running over her foot with a car.
Porter's first wife, Colbie Holderness, revealed an image of herself with a blackened eye in 2005, which she said she received from Porter punching her while they were on vacation in Florence, Italy. In June 2010, Porter's second wife, Jennie Willoughby, filed an emergency protective order against Porter, whom she says dragged her naked from the shower.
Porter has denied the allegations.
In the wake of the claims, the president wished Porter well on Friday, saying nothing of Porter's accusers other than he was ""very sad"" to hear of the allegations.
""He worked very hard,"" the president said in the Oval Office Friday. ""I found out about it recently and I was surprised by it. But we certainly wish him well. It's obviously a tough time for him. He did a very good job when he was in the White House. And we hope he has a wonderful career, and hopefully he will have a great career ahead of him. But it was very sad when we heard about it, and certainly he's also very sad. Now he also as you probably know, he says he's innocent. And I think you have to remember that. He said very strongly yesterday that he's innocent. So you'll have to talk to him about that. But we absolutely wish him well. Did a very good job while he was at the White House.""
The White House's response to the allegations leveled against Porter sent the White House scrambling. Porter warned White House counsel Don McGahn in January 2017 that there could be a holdup with his security clearance, CBS News has reported. In June 2017, Porter's preliminary file was sent from the FBI to the White House security office. It contained information from his ex-wives alleging abuse. The file never went to McGahn personally, but it may have gone to another attorney in the White House counsel's office. In September of 2017, Porter told McGahn the FBI had interviewed him a second time.
McGahn became more clearly aware of the nature of those concerns in November 2017 when Porter's former girlfriend called him to tell him of the abuse allegations from the former wives. Shortly after that, McGahn informed chief of staff John Kelly that there could be problems related to Porter's security clearance. But, the White House took no action, waiting until after the Daily Mail reported the former wives' claims Tuesday night. White House communications director Hope Hicks, CBS News has confirmed, is dating Porter, although it's unclear when she became aware of the allegations.

42106,Breitbart,Teachers Seek Help to Cope with Rising Islamic Extremism in the Classroom,"Rising fundamentalism amongst Muslim youths in Germany is sparking alarm in the nation’s schools, with more and more teachers seeking help in dealing with radicalised pupils.
Since October last year, a hotline set up by the Federal Ministry for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) has increasingly been inundated with calls from teachers and school mental health workers concerned about Islamic extremism.
“Most of the children have grown up in a Salafist environment — that is to say, their parents are radicalised,” said Florian Endres, from Nuremberg Advisory Centre on Radicalisation.
Domestic intelligence chief Hans-Georg Maassen warned in December that support for radical Islam was at “an all-time high”, with the number of Salafists identified by authorities as living in Germany having grown to 10,800 from just 3,700 in 2011.
Police confirm 15-year-old girl who stabbed police officer was ISIS youth https://t.co/tLolBfZPZA pic.twitter.com/UTdFoZff3F — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 16, 2016
The Centre for Coordination of the Network to Prevent Extremism (KPEBW), which was set up by the Baden-Württemberg state government in 2015, has been training school psychologists in how to recognise extremism amongst Muslim pupils.
“For many teachers, there is a great deal of uncertainty in the context [of Islamic extremism],” said Asiye Sari-Turan who briefed a group of 55 mental health professionals working at schools across Germany on extremism over the course of a three-day KPEBW training event held in December.
“[Teachers and school psychologists] often lack awareness with regards to how to distinguish between regular behaviour, that has maybe been brought on by puberty, and extremism,” she told the Schwäbisches Tagblatt on Monday.
As well as focusing on the psychology of radicalisation and the threat Salafist ideology poses to Germany, the seminars also taught school staff how to recognise jihadist symbols and code that young people post on the internet such as the Islamic State flag, or a picture of lions.
“During the training, participants said: Now that you’ve explained the codes and symbols, I remember seeing that,” Sari-Turan added.
Germany Opened 1,000 Investigations into Radical Islamic Extremists in 2017 https://t.co/ZlD5pcIa8j — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2018
A KPEBW resource entitled ‘Promoting Integration, Recognising Radicalisation — Guidelines for Teachers in Education and Vocational Training’, says schools should be alert if pupils show “emphatic rejection of the views of teachers and classmates as haram (forbidden)”.
Other warning signs highlighted in the booklet include Muslim youths turning their back on music and other leisure activities, and radically changing their behaviour towards the opposite sex.
Intelligence services recently warned that a growing number of female Islamic extremists have begun to come to prominence in Germany’s Salafist scene as their husbands are sent to prison.
As Breitbart London previously reported, the Agency for the Protection of the Constitution in North Rhine-Westphalia said they have identified more than 40 female extremists authorities believe are radicalising the next generation of jihadis.",RIGHT

67963,NPR,Why Are New Hampshire's Tax-Free Liquor Stores Selling So Much Hennessy?,"Why Are New Hampshire's Tax-Free Liquor Stores Selling So Much Hennessy?
Enlarge this image toggle caption New York State Department of Taxation and Finance New York State Department of Taxation and Finance
New Hampshire doesn't have a signature drink, unless you like your maple syrup served neat.
But in recent years, sales of one particular brand of cognac have surged at state-run liquor stores. So much Hennessy is being sold, in fact, that one New Hampshire official is asking the state Attorney General Gordon MacDonald to investigate whether the Liquor Commission is turning a blind eye to bootlegging and money-laundering activities.
New Hampshire, despite its pronounced libertarian streak, is one of 17 ""control"" states, meaning the government manages the distribution of spirits. The state's Liquor Commission, which is run by an appointed chairman, oversees 79 retail stores.
Andru Volinsky, a Democrat who serves on the state's five-member Executive Council, an elected body that serves as a kind of watchdog over the executive branch, made the allegations public last month.
After being tipped off by a whistleblower, Volinsky says he recently witnessed two people who arrived in a vehicle with New York license plates spend approximately $24,000 on Hennessy products. At the register, they allegedly divided the sale into three transactions and paid using ""a very large wad of cash."" He suspects people are buying up large quantities of New Hampshire's tax-free booze to sell elsewhere.
The IRS requires businesses to document when someone spends more than $10,000 in cash on a single purchase. By allowing customers to break up the transactions, Volinsky contends the Liquor Commission may be evading that reporting requirement. He's also concerned that the Liquor Commission isn't doing enough to police customers who may stop at multiple stores in a single day to avoid triggering the $10,000 reporting requirement.
These practices ""may be illegal and unquestionably facilitate money laundering,"" writes Volinsky in a letter to the governor and state attorney general.
Liquor Commission denies allegations
The New Hampshire Liquor Commission is a cash cow, generating more than $150 million in profits last year that went directly into the state's general fund. These government-run liquor stores are strategically located near the state's borders, including at highway rest stops, where motorists can enjoy tax-free shopping and better prices than in nearby Vermont and Massachusetts.
According to publicly available online inventories, those border stores stock huge quantities of Hennessy products. Meanwhile, just a handful of bottles may be on the shelves at stores located far from the border.
It isn't clear why Hennessy appears to be the brand of choice for bootleggers, but the price difference between New Hampshire's bottles and the highly-taxed New York bottles is likely one draw. Also, government officials have offered anecdotal evidence that some of the booze is headed for Chinese restaurants, as well as gentleman's clubs in the greater New York City region.
""I started hearing anecdotes of people coming in with wads of cash stuffed in their socks,"" Volinsky tells New Hampshire Public Radio. ""Wads of cash that smell of perfume because on Wednesdays, apparently the strip club owners in New York come over to buy their liquor in bulk, and the office of the liquor store smells from the perfume.""
For its part, the Liquor Commission flatly denies Volinsky's allegations.
""There's nothing illegal or unscrupulous about making large sales to out-of-state customers as long as our employees follow the policies in place set forth by the state and federal government,"" writes the commission in a statement. It has provided employees with a step-by-step guide to ensure financial disclosure laws are appropriately followed.
The Commission, along with top Republicans in the state, including Governor Chris Sununu, have gone on the attack, criticizing Volinsky for his ""sting operation,"" and are calling for the attorney general to investigate him.
Previous investigation
While a partisan tit-for-tat was perhaps inevitable, many of the concerns raised by Volinsky are not new to New Hampshire officials, or to law enforcement in neighboring states.
In fact, in 2012, it was a top GOP lawmaker who called for a special House committee to investigate potential wrongdoing within the Liquor Commission, including how it handles large cash purchases.
That committee's final report included two anecdotes of out-of-state residents arrested in Massachusetts with large hauls of New Hampshire-purchased booze. One of those arrests included 1,676 bottles of Hennessy, bought at multiple locations. The driver was charged with possessing untaxed liquor and unlawfully transporting liquor.
More recently, liquor enforcement officials in Vermont have made two arrests, one involving an estimated $40,000 worth of New Hampshire-purchased liquor in the back of an SUV, the other with an estimated $28,000 worth. Both suspects were charged with crossing state lines in possession of more than nine liters of alcohol, Vermont's current legal limit.
""The product that was the most prominent in both of these cases was Hennessy cognac,"" says Patrick Delaney, Vermont's Commissioner of Liquor Control, who backs increasing the financial penalties for those caught illegally importing large quantities of liquor. He adds that ""by using cash, there is obviously no paper trail, if an authority were to investigate it. The activity itself is basically tax evasion.""
An IRS spokesperson says the agency is ""aware of this and similar schemes"" but wouldn't confirm any active investigation into all-cash bulk transactions in New Hampshire.
Potential repercussions
Politicians are not the only ones asking questions. Some employees of New Hampshire liquor stores are raising concerns about their role in processing these transactions.
""They are starting to feel like a drug dealer,"" says Richard Gulla, president of the State Employees Association, the union which represents rank and file liquor store employees.
To handle the huge stacks of cash and speed up transactions, the Liquor Commission has installed 20 bill-counting machines at stores around the state, and says it plans to roll out more units.
Volinsky sees these steps and others taken by the Liquor Commission as ""alarming.""
The state attorney general's office says it is reviewing the documents submitted by Volinsky and isn't yet able to comment on their contents.

34744,ABC News,January was hottest month ever recorded in New Zealand,"January was the hottest month ever recorded in New Zealand according to figures released Friday, and experts say climate change is one factor.
The heat has led to a shortage of fans that Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern jokingly referred to as ""fan-ageddon."" Ardern said that while many people are probably enjoying a great summer, they also need to consider the long-term consequences of climate change, including sea-level rise.
Figures released by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research indicate the average temperature during January was 20.3 degrees Celsius (68.5 Fahrenheit). That was more than 3 degrees Celsius above normal and beat the previous record of 19.6 Celsius set in February 1998.
Record-keeping began in 1909.
Gregor Macara, a climate scientist with the weather agency, said that warmer seas, generally settled weather and more winds from the tropical north had led to the higher temperatures. He said climate change was an underlying and contributing factor.
February began on a different note as New Zealand was hit by a tropical storm which brought heavy rainfall, flooding and cooler temperatures. But Macara said the agency still anticipates temperatures for the month will be higher than normal.
New Zealand has a relatively mild climate that is moderated by the surrounding ocean.
In an interview this week with The Associated Press, Ardern said she and her partner Clarke Gayford found themselves enduring the heatwave in Auckland without a fan until Gayford remembered he had a broken-down one stored in their attic.

3644,HuffPost,Florida Lawmakers Are Taking Anti-immigrant Bias To New Heights And Preparing To Hurt More Families In The Process,"By Thomas Kennedy
Early in 2017, Donald Trump signed an executive order threatening to rescind federal funds from local municipalities that refuse to criminalize immigrant communities. The executive order has suffered numerous legal setbacks since then, the most recent being a decision by a federal judge in California ruling it unconstitutional and issuing a permanent injunction, effectively blocking it.
Despite this, some lawmakers in Florida are attempting to pass dangerous legislation that threatens the wellbeing of immigrant families.
House Bill 9 (HB9) has been introduced by Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran and has so far been fast tracked through committee. The current Florida House of Representatives website currently has an ominous looking banner in its homepage, with information both about the bill and so called “sanctuary cities,” in what I interpret as a scare tactic.
Anti-immigrant legislation in Florida is not new. Immigration advocacy groups have been fighting against dangerous bills like HB9 for years, most memorably in 2011 when the state capitol in Tallahassee was flooded by activists from the Florida Immigrant Coalition who were taking part in a We Are Florida campaign and were able to stop an Arizona style “Show me your papers” law. Advocates have spent almost every legislative session since then fighting against the criminalization of immigrant families.
The upcoming gubernatorial race, and especially the contested primary on the Republican side, is contributing to the urgency lawmakers seem to be feeling in Florida regarding anti-immigrant efforts. The Republican candidates seem to be in a competition to outdo each other in terms of who is the best adherent of Trumpism.
Perceived frontrunner Adam Putnam has downplayed support for legislation he once co-sponsored that would have allowed undocumented immigrants to work in the United States and receive a pathway to legal residency.
Rep. Ron Desantis, who has won Trump’s endorsement, had this to say after Trump rescinded DACA, the executive order granting protection from deportation to thousands of undocumented students: “When he did it, how the media has reacted, how most politicians – Democrats and even a lot of Republicans – react; the sole focus is on what can Congress do to benefit an illegal immigrant?”
But the current bill before Florida lawmakers takes anti-immigrant bias to new heights. The bill would discourage immigrants who are victims of a crime from cooperating with law enforcement agencies, would criminalize immigrant parents of U.S. citizens in Florida and would infringe on the power of local municipalities from enacting policies that would serve the best interests of their residents.
In an editorial in the Tampa Bay Times, Corcoran said, “Our bill is simple: State and local governments must comply with and support the enforcement of federal immigration laws — end of story. Any elected officials who thinks they can circumvent the Constitution and the laws of our nation will face significant penalties, along with suspension or removal from office.”
That is perhaps one of the most troubling aspects of the proposed law, it will leave elected officials who do not support the criminalization and deportation of immigrant families vulnerable to being removed from office. That is simply not in the spirit of American democracy, and would create a dangerous slippery slope in which authoritarians could use similar laws to silence their opposition. It simply cannot be allowed to happen.
HB9 cannot be allowed to pass by the Florida Legislature. It would make our communities less safe by eroding the trust between the public and law enforcement, would lead to the racial profiling and discrimination of immigrant communities, and would cost Florida residents thousands upon thousands of taxpayer dollars. Furthermore, studies have repeatedly found that municipalities and counties with sanctuary or welcoming policies are safer and have better economies than those without.
In the past, bipartisan efforts by both Democrats and Republicans in the Florida Senate have defeated these anti-immigrant bills. Considering the current moment, we need state lawmakers to step up and do right by the most vulnerable communities in the state of Florida.",LEFT
184269,NPR,What We Know : NPR,"What We Know: Family Separation And 'Zero Tolerance' At The Border
Enlarge this image toggle caption U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Rio Grande Valley Sector via AP U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Rio Grande Valley Sector via AP
Since early May, 2,342 children have been separated from their parents after crossing the Southern U.S. border, according to the Department of Homeland Security, as part of a new immigration strategy by the Trump administration that has prompted widespread outcry.
Here's what we know about the policy, its history and its effects:
Does the Trump administration have a policy of separating families at the border?
Yes.
In April, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered prosecutors along the border to ""adopt immediately a zero-tolerance policy"" for illegal border crossings. That included prosecuting parents traveling with their children as well as people who subsequently attempted to request asylum.
White House officials have repeatedly acknowledged that under that new policy, they separate all families who cross the border. Sessions has described it as deterrence.
In Their Own Words President Trump: ""The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility. ... Not on my watch."" Attorney General Jeff Sessions: ""If you cross this border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It's that simple. ... If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law. If you don't like that, then don't smuggle children over our border."" Sessions on whether the policy is a deterrent: ""Yes, hopefully people will get the message and come through the border at the port of entry and not break across the border unlawfully."" Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen: Under the ""zero tolerance"" policy, when families cross the border illegally, ""Operationally, what that means is we will have to separate your family. That's no different than what we do every day in every part of the United States when an adult of a family commits a crime."" White House Chief of Staff John Kelly: Separating families is ""a tough deterrent. ... The children will be taken care of — put into foster care or whatever. But the big point is they elected to come illegally into the United States and this is a technique that no one hopes will be used extensively or for very long.""
U.S. Customs and Border Protection explains on its site and in a flyer that border-crossing families will be separated.
The policy is unique to the Trump administration. Previous administrations did not, as a general principle, separate all families crossing the U.S. border illegally. And the current administration could choose to end this practice and release families together from detention at any time.
What happens when families are separated?
The process begins at a Border Patrol detention facility. But many details about what happens next — how children are taken from their parents and by whom — are unclear.
According to the Texas Civil Rights Project, which has been able to speak with detained adults, multiple parents reported that they were separated from their children and not given any information about where their children would go. The organization also says that in some cases, the children were taken away under the pretense that they would be getting a bath.
The Los Angeles Times spoke to unnamed Homeland Security officials who said parents are given information about the family separation process and that ""accusations of surreptitious efforts to separate are completely false.""
From the point of separation forward, the policy for treating the separated children appears to be the same as existing systems for detaining and housing unaccompanied immigrant children — designed for minors who cross the border alone. Those unaccompanied minors are generally older than the children affected by family separation.

Where do the children go once they've been separated?
The answer varies over time. Children begin at Border Patrol facilities, are transferred to longer-term shelters and are supposed to eventually be placed with families or sponsors. Here's more about each step:
Border Patrol facilities. If you've seen photos of children in what look like chain-link cages — whether unaccompanied minors in 2014 or separated children in 2018 — they are probably photos from a Border Patrol facility.
Children usually are held here initially, but it is illegal to keep them for more than three days — these holding cells are not meant for long-term detainment.
The Associated Press visited one site on Monday and described a ""large, dark facility"" with separate wings for children, adults and families:
""Inside an old warehouse in South Texas, hundreds of children wait in a series of cages created by metal fencing. One cage had 20 children inside. Scattered about are bottles of water, bags of chips and large foil sheets intended to serve as blankets.""
Such facilities have been criticized before for poor conditions and reports of abuse and inhumane treatment, including a number of allegations the CBP strongly denies.
Child immigrant shelters. Within three days, children are supposed to be transferred from immigration detention to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services.
For 15 years, ORR has handled the ""care and placement"" of unaccompanied migrant children. Until recently, that usually meant minors who crossed into the U.S. alone. Now it also includes children who have been separated from their families by authorities, including much younger children.
ORR has a network of about 100 shelter facilities, all operated by nonprofit groups, where children are detained.
NPR's John Burnett recently joined other reporters to visit one such facility, a converted Walmart Supercenter housing nearly 1,500 boys ages 10 to 17. Journalists' access to that facility in Brownsville, Texas, was limited, but the site was markedly different from Border Patrol facilities seen in photos released by the government — the teenage boys slept on beds instead of mats in the floor, in rooms instead of cages, and had access to classes and games.
ORR says children remain at these shelters for ""fewer than 57 days on average."" However some children have been kept detained for months longer than that, and some advocates say certain facilities improperly administer psychotropic medications.
Observers have raised concerns about the psychological toll on young children who enter this shelter system. NPR's Joel Rose talked to one former shelter employee who said he quit after he was instructed to prevent siblings from hugging each other. The organization that runs the shelter said it allows touching and hugging in certain circumstances.
Where are the girls and young children?
Official photos and videos have shown only older boys at shelter facilities.
HHS says there are specialized shelters for children under 13. No images from those shelters have been released, but authorities say new images and videos will be provided later this week.
More than 10,000 migrant children, including children who crossed the border alone, are kept in ORR facilities. And existing facilities are filling up — the shelter Burnett visited was 95 percent full.
Tent camps. A temporary facility has been set up in Tornillo, Texas, near El Paso. Little is known about the facility, and reporters have not been allowed outside, but KQED's John Sepulvado has seen the tent from outside.
""It's a heavy-duty-grade white tent in the middle of a desert,"" he told NPR's Here & Now. ""It's behind two chain-link fences and there's a dirt easement that's on top of it so you can't actually see into it from the American side.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters
""It's not a city — there aren't multiples of tents,"" he said. ""It's just all one tent where these 16- and 17-year-olds are at.""
It's not clear how many teenagers are inside, he says, but the government plans to expand it to hold some 4,000 detained minors.
This is not the first time the U.S. government has used temporary shelters for minors: During the surge of unaccompanied minors crossing the border in 2014, HHS set up several temporary facilities at military bases.
Sponsors or family members: Ultimately, ORR tries to find family members, foster parents or sponsors to take in children. Parents are the preferred option, but that's not a possibility for children who have been separated from parents who remain in detention.
There is no time limit on how long it can take to find a home for a child, but again, ORR says that on average the process takes less than two months.
By law, those relatives or sponsors must, among other requirements, show that they can provide for the minor — sometimes verified with home visits — and ensure the minor's attendance at any future court hearing.
The Trump administration has said that it intends to subject sponsors to increased scrutiny.
Under those new rules, the criminal background and immigration status of all sponsors, and any other adult living in the household, will be examined. Biometric data, such as fingerprints, also will be required. The checks will be performed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and not by ORR.
Critics say these new background checks will have a chilling effect.
""Under the current circumstances and given the anti-immigrant rhetoric of the administration, it may be that few will be willing to come forward to claim children,"" said Bob Carey, who was director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement under the Obama administration.
Can parents who are prosecuted be reunited with their children?
Parents face a court hearing where, as NPR's John Burnett has reported, they may face objections from prosecutors if their lawyers try to bring up their children in a bid for leniency.
If parents are eventually released from detention, they will be able to take custody of their own children, Nielsen said at a news conference Monday.
ICE instructions on how to find a separated child The Immigration and Customs Enforcement call center is available M-F, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET, at 1-888-351-4024 (or 9116# from within an ICE facility)
Parents can call the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which operates shelters, at 1-800-203-7001 (or 699# from within an ICE detention facility)
Friends, family and advocates can email ICE at Parental.Interests@ice.dhs.gov or ORR at information@ORRNCC.com
In a statement to NPR, ICE expanded on the process of family reunification.
During a parent's detention, ""ICE and ORR will work together to locate separated children, verify the parent/child relationship, and set up regular communication and removal coordination, if necessary,"" ICE says. A hotline has been set up to help parents and children find each other.
""ICE will make every effort to reunite the child with the parent once the parent's immigration case has been adjudicated,"" a spokesman said. Parents being deported may request that their children leave with them, or may decide to leave the child in the U.S. to pursue their own immigration claim, ICE says. For instance, they might suggest another family member in the U.S. to sponsor their child, as described above.
However, The New Yorker spoke to lawyers and advocates who said there is no formal process or clear protocol for tracking parents and children within the system, and that chaotic systems and inadequate record-keeping make it difficult even to know which facility a child might be kept at.
And The New York Times reports that some parents have been deported without their children, against their will.
What is the law regarding the treatment of migrant children?
A two-decade-old court settlement, the Flores settlement, and a law called the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (or TVPRA) both specify how the government must treat migrant children.
They require that migrant children be placed in ""the least restrictive environment,"" or sent to live with family members. They also limit how long families with children can be detained; courts have interpreted that limit as 20 days.
Previous administrations have released families to meet these requirements. President Trump has said the law requires him to separate families, which is not true. His advisers have presented a more complicated argument for how the law requires family separation.
""The laws prohibit us from detaining families while they go through prosecution,"" Homeland Secretary Nielsen said on Monday — a reference to the 20-day limits on how long children can be detained. Therefore, she says, ""we cannot detain families together.""
She argues that that leaves the administration with the options of not enforcing the law, which they reject, or separating families. But immigration advocates and legal experts say that there are other options, including those previous administrations have chosen.
What was the policy under President Obama?
The Obama administration established family detention centers that kept families together while their cases were processed.
However, those centers were sharply criticized for keeping children detained even if they were still with their parents. A court ruled that those detention centers violated the Flores agreement and that families should be released together.
The Obama White House also had a policy of releasing families through a program called Alternatives to Detention that still allowed them to be closely supervised — for instance, by giving mothers ankle monitors before releasing them.
The ACLU welcomed the Alternatives to Detention program but other immigrant rights groups had reservations.
As NPR's John Burnett reported, one for-profit prison company that was making money off immigrant detention was also profiting off those ankle monitor systems.
ICE tells NPR that the Alternatives to Detention program is still active under the Trump administration, but Trump has repeatedly said he opposes what he denounces as ""catch-and-release.""
Can families claim asylum, allowing them to stay together?
Hypothetically, yes. In practice, maybe not.
Families that claim asylum at ports of entry are meant to be kept together while their claims are processed.
But there is evidence that even families who seek asylum at ports of entry are being separated. One high-profile case involves a Congolese woman who sought asylum and still was separated from her 7-year-old daughter. In February, NPR's Burnett reported on the legal battle of Ms. L v. ICE.
What is asylum? Claiming asylum means asking the U.S. to accept you — legally — because of persecution you're facing in your home country. Crossing the border illegally is a misdemeanor; for a person who's already been deported once, it's a felony. Both types of crimes are currently being prosecuted with no exceptions, even if a person later claims asylum. Claiming asylum at a port of entry, however, is not a crime at all.
Hers is not an isolated case, according to immigrant advocates.
""Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service has documented 53 incidents of family separation in the last nine months, mostly Central Americans. Other immigrant support groups say there are many more cases,"" Burnett reported.
Reporter Jean Guerrero of KPBS in San Diego reported on the case of a Salvadoran father, Jose Demar Fuentes, who says he sought asylum and was separated from his 1-year-old son, Mateo, despite having an original birth certificate proving that he is the boy's father.
In a White House press briefing Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said, ""DHS is not separating families legitimately seeking asylum at ports of entry."" But she said DHS ""will only separate a family if we cannot determine there is a familial relationship, if child is at risk with the parent or legal guardian, or if the parent or legal guardian is referred for prosecution.""
Burnett also has reported that some families are not being allowed to claim asylum — that they are being repeatedly turned away and told the CBP facility is too full to accept them.
Nielsen has denied that some asylum-seekers who present themselves at a port of entry are being turned away, which would be a violation of international law.
""We are saying we want to take care of you in the right way. Right now we do not have the resources at this particular moment in time. Come back,"" she said.",LEFT
3231,The Guardian,Research every teacher should know: growth mindset,"In his series of articles on how psychology research can inform teaching, Bradley Busch picks an academic study and makes sense of it for the classroom. This time: an influential research project on growth mindset
There is a wealth of psychology research that can help teachers to improve how they work with students, but academic studies of this kind aren’t always easy to access or translate into the realities of classroom practice. This series seeks to redress that by taking a selection of studies and making sense of the important information for teachers, as we all seek to answer the question: how can we help our students do better at school? This time, we consider growth mindset.
Growth mindset – the idea that intelligence can be developed rather than it being set in stone – is arguably the most popular psychological theory in education at the moment. It was launched into mainstream consciousness after a seminal growth mindset study almost 20 years ago and has since spawned many assemblies and form tutor-time activities. But what were the findings of this influential study?
The problem with praise such as ​​'you're so clever​' is that it doesn't tell students what they need to do next time
Writing in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 1998, Claudia Mueller and Carol Dweck from Columbia University, New York, explored the consequences of how different types of praise affected students. The research paper is actually a combination of six separate studies.
In each, students aged nine to 12 years old completed a problem-solving game. They were then told they’d got 80% of the questions right and were praised for either their natural intelligence or how hard they worked on the task. The researchers reported on how the students felt, thought and behaved in subsequent tasks.
What are the main findings?
Children who were praised for their intelligence were more likely to choose future tasks that they thought would make them look smart. Children who had been praised for their effort tended to choose tasks that would help them learn new things.
Children praised for their intelligence said they enjoyed the task less when compared to the children who had been praised for their effort.
Children praised for their intelligence were less likely to persist on tasks than the children who had been praised for their effort.
Children who had been praised for their intelligence performed worse in future tasks. The children who had been praised for their effort performed better in future tasks.
The majority (86%) of children praised for their intelligence asked for information about how their peers did on the same task. Only 23% of children who had been praised for effort asked for this type of feedback – most of them asked for feedback about how they could do better.
A significant proportion (38%) of children praised for their ability lied about the number of problems they solved in the task. Only 13% of the children praised for effort did the same.
Related research
In the intervening years, the impact of growth mindset has been studied by many different researchers around the world. The overwhelming majority of these have found that having a growth mindset is associated with getting better grades. Some of these studies included a very large sample size, of more than 100,000 students. However, two recent studies paint a slightly more cloudy picture.
Growth mindset: practical tips you may not have tried yet Read more
In England, researchers found that improvements in English and maths [pdf] attributed to growth mindset interventions (on average, students made two months’ additional progress) could have been down to chance. The other study, involving 222 students in China, found no relationship between student mindset and their academic performance.
But beyond improved attainment, research suggests having a growth mindset has other advantages, including coping better with transition, higher self-regulation, grit and pro-social behaviours. There is also evidence suggesting mental health benefits – those with a growth mindset have been found to be less aggressive, with higher self-esteem and fewer symptoms associated with depression and anxiety.
What does this mean for the classroom?
This study highlights the complexities and importance of how we deliver feedback. The problem with praise such as “you’re so clever” or “you must be so talented” is that it doesn’t tell students what they need to do next time.
By praising their effort and the strategies they used, we give students a template of behaviour to follow. As the authors of the study noted: “Children exposed to this intelligence feedback were likely to respond negatively when they faced achievement setbacks … children given effort feedback, who valued learning over performance, were less likely to fall apart when they experienced an isolated low performance.” Studies like this must therefore make us consider the merit of calling certain students “gifted and talented”.
It’s also worth being aware of the ways in which the idea of growth mindset is sometimes misunderstood. In the rush to embrace it as a method, the message has sometimes been diluted to “growth mindset is all about effort” or morphed into “anyone can do anything” – neither of which is accurate or helpful. Having a growth mindset is about the belief that someone can learn and improve. To help shape students’ behaviours and mindsets, teachers should look to develop a consistent culture of high expectations and quality feedback.

177598,Breitbart,Virgil: A Lesson from Brazil on What Could Happen if We Lose the Trade War with China,"There’s been so much going on in recent weeks that it’s hard to remember that the biggest story in the world is the rapid rise of China.
Yes, it’s fascinating to see what’s happening with the Trump-Kim Summit in Singapore, or at the Trump vs. Trudeau Smackdown in Canada, or to peek into the the bottomless Swampathon of Washington, DC. Yet still, while it’s not always atop the headlines, the most consequential story of the age is the rise and rise of the People’s Republic.
And perhaps the fate of a city in Brazil serves as a parable as to what could be looming for our American republic. Virgil will get to that scary parable in a moment, but first, let’s consider the latest news.
An Artful Deal with China—But Artful for Whom?
On June 12, China’s telecom giant ZTE announced it is resuming business operations, after having been staved off some U.S. sanctions that could have shut it down completely. A bipartisan group of US Senators is still struggling to toughen up those sanctions, and so it’s unclear what will happen next, but it seems likely, in the end, that ZTE will wriggle out of the most serious possible punishment. Which is to say, how long do you think it will be before ZTE is back up to its old tricks?
In other words, the Chinese seem to be showing that they understand, too, 交易的艺术—The Art of the Deal.
And speaking of deals, late last month, National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow said the administration was “making terrific progress” in its trade talks with China, aimed at lowering the U.S. trade deficit with that country, currently running at $375 billion annually. That same day, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, “We’re putting the trade war on hold,” pending possible progress.
Of course, some were skeptical—even in surprising places. For instance, also late last month, The Washington Post headlined, “China is winning Trump’s trade war.” Yes, we know where the “Bezos Post” is coming from, but still, the story quoted a number of experts and politicians, all of whom argued that the Chinese are likely to be unyielding on key trade issues, such as manufacturing exports and the protection of U.S. intellectual property (IP). And the Post cited the administration’s own estimate that China is stealing between $225 billion and $600 billion worth of our IP each year. We might pause to observe that it’s these matters of technological know-how that are the crux of national power—even national survival.
Interestingly, this somber realization is starting to penetrate Beltway thinking. For instance, a recent headline atop Axios, the buzzy Beltway publication, was veritably Trumpian: “1 big thing: The greatest, growing threat to America.” The article detailed China’s 2025 Plan, which calls for the country “to dominate all futuristic advanced technologies such as robotics, A.I., aviation and space, driverless or new energy vehicles.” The conclusion is inescapable: If the Chinese beat us in all those categories, they beat us, period.
Of course, Donald Trump has been sounding exactly this alarm for decades, even when the bipartisan Establishment was swooning over the mirage of globalism. Giving credit where credit is due, the author of the piece, Jim VandeHei—one of the most influential journalists in Washington, DC—added a note about the 45th President: “Trump showed you can turn China into a villain on trade.” Looking beyond Trump, VandeHei added: “A smart politician could turn China into a unifying villain on virtually every topic—a reason to move fast and together on infrastructure, immigration, regulations, space, robotics, 5G and next-gen education.”
In other words, the threat from China could finally galvanize the U.S. to do the things that we should have been doing all along.
And so it was interesting to see that at the moment that the importance of technology was being acknowledged, the breaking news from the White House was about agriculture; on May 21, Trump tweeted the news:
China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products – would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years!
Yes, undoubtedly the President is correct when he says that this deal would be one the best thing to happen to US farmers—and farmers and their farms are certainly important; we do, after all, have to eat. However, as we have seen, the most profound concerns are elsewhere. What matters most to our national destiny is tech, not ag.
Virgil doesn’t often find himself agree with Sen. Chuck Schumer, but the New York Democrat had a piercing point when he jibed soon thereafter:
China’s trade negotiators must be laughing themselves all the way back to Beijing. They’re playing us for fools — temporary purchase of some goods, while China continues to steal our family jewels, the things that have made America great: the intellectual property, the know-how in the highest end industries.
Virgil will leave it to others to assess Schumer’s credibility on this issue; for sure, he seems more critical of Trump than he was of, say, Barack Obama. And yet also for sure, he’s right about this much: The ultimate issue in national prosperity, even national survival, is know-how. That is, do we know how to do something better than our economic and military rivals? And a look back at history drills that point home—you have to stay ahead of the competition.
Silicon Valley, Meet Manaus, Brazil
Nobody should ever make the mistake of thinking that anything about the economy is permanent. That is, the economy is always churning and changing; some players are winning, and some are losing. Moreover, the same holds true for society and, indeed, for history itself; one empire rises, another falls. And it’s hard to say that any country is immune, not even the United States.
A classic expression of this waxing and waning is the 1818 poem by Percy Shelley, Ozymandias. That work describes a traveler trekking through the desert, coming across the remains of a once-towering statue:
And on the pedestal, these words appear:
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
The poem concludes on a somber note:
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.
Ozymandias, by the way, was a real king. His name is better known to us as Ramses II; he was a pharaoh in Egypt’s glory days, when Egypt was arguably the world’s leading civilization. And yet now…
Such gloomy thoughts, about the death of kings and kingdoms, were brought to Virgil’s mind by a recent headline, “In Silicon Valley, Chinese ‘accelerators’ aim to bring startups home.” The Reuters article details the efforts of the People’s Republic of China to invest in and learn from—some would say, steal from—the greatest U.S. tech firms.
Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, outlined the risk:
Our intellectual property is the future of our economy and our security. China’s government has clearly prioritized acquiring as much of that intellectual property as possible. Their ongoing efforts, legal or illegal, pose a risk that we have to look at very seriously.
We might emphasize Warner’s use of the word “illegal.” Why, he might even agree with the Trump administration’s estimate that China steals as much as $600 billion of our intellectual property every year. In fact, that same day, May 17, the President himself declared, “We have been ripped off by China”—and this only hours before a visit to the White House by Chinese vice premier Liu He.
So what could happen to the US if this thievery continues? Today, without a doubt, the US enjoys tech pre-eminence. The largest of our tech titans, the so-called GAFA companies—Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon—have a total market capitalization of more than $2.4 trillion, vastly greater than that of the Chinese tech companies.
Of course, as we all know, China is catching up fast—in everything. Just a decade ago, China’s GDP was less than a third of America’s, and yet if current growth rates continue—the U.S. at around 2 percent, and China at around 6.5 percent—China will overtake the U.S. in 2027. If that projection proves true, then America’s tech edge could vanish just as surely as that statue of Ozymandias.
In fact, if we want a glimpse of what a possible future might look like, we might take a look at Manaus, Brazil. That city’s bitter history illustrates what can happen when someone steals away your economic mojo.
Today, Manaus is just another Brazilian city, population 2.1 million. And yet in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was one of the boom cities of the world, based on a supremely valuable product: rubber.
The peoples of the Amazon had long known that a viscous substance, latex, could be tapped from the Hevea brasiliensis tree; they had found occasional uses for it when it dried into rubber.
Yet natural rubber had a problem: It invariably turned gooey in the summer and brittle in the winter, and so it wasn’t good for much. But all that changed after 1839, when the American inventor Charles Goodyear figured out how to “vulcanize”—that is, permanently weatherproof—latex rubber.
Goodyear’s vulcanization opened up new vistas for the use for rubber; it was now not just a curiosity, but a valuable commodity. And so all of a sudden, in the mid 19th century, attention—and money—turned to the source of that rubber, the Amazon rain forest. And in the middle was Manaus. Thus that city fluked its way into a worldwide monopoly on rubber production.
Local land-owners—we might call them “Rubber Barons”—got rich quick, and then some. And amidst the riotous luxury of life at the top—Manaus was said to lead the world in both diamond-purchasing and brothel-patronizing—a few noble and lasting structures were created, such as the Manaus Opera House. When that grand edifice was completed in 1896, it ranked as one of the largest theaters in the world.
Yet then came nemesis for Manaus. Just as the folks there were living it up, their competitive advantage was winding down. Or, more precisely, it was sailing away across the Pacific, gone to Asia.
In 1876, a wily British agriculturalist, Henry Wickham, came to Manaus and left with 70,000 Hevea seeds. His goal was profitable nationalism; he would take the seeds to a British colony and plant them there, so that rubber production could thrive under the Union Jack, not under the mostly green-and-yellow flag of Brazil.
It took a few decades to get the hang of rubber-growing in a non-native climate, but soon enough, British planters succeeded in growing rubber in two of their colonies, Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Malaya (Malaysia).
Indeed the British, with their superior sense of industry, had actually improved on the Brazilians. Whereas in Manaus the rubber workers simply went out into the wild looking for trees to tap, the Brits established efficient rubber plantations.
Thus Brazil lost its monopoly profits. By 1910, Brazilian production had fallen to 50 percent of the world market; by 1918, it was down to 20 percent, and in 1940, it was barely more than one percent. Manaus’ opera-house-building days were over. (Since then, of course, synthetic rubber, a technology pioneered in the U.S. during World War Two, has taken over.)
Okay, so there you have the doomsday scenario: Silicon Valley could end up suffering the fate of Manaus, with the Chinese today playing the role of the British yesterday.
Virgil is not arguing that Silicon Valley could become another Manaus as the Chinese eat our lunch—at least not right away. Yet over time, as we have seen, anything can happen. Just as world history is full of rich empires that have fallen by the wayside—from ancient Egypt to dear old Rome—so, too, it is full of rich economies that fell, and couldn’t get up.
Of course, some will insist that the similarities between Manaus, then, and Silicon Valley, now, are much less than the dissimilarities. That is, they insist, It can’t happen here.
To which there’s only thing to say: We’ll find out.
And of this much, Virgil is sure: The world has not seen its last Ozymandias.",RIGHT
46640,Politico,"Schiff complains FBI, Justice Department making too many demands on Russia memo","Rep. Adam Schiff speculated that ""the White House must have asked"" the FBI and the Justice Department to raise these broad concerns. | Alex Brandon/AP Photo Schiff complains FBI, Justice Department making too many demands on Russia memo The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee suggested that the White House might be instructing law enforcement officials to delay the Democratic document.
The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee suggested Wednesday that the FBI and the Justice Department are asking for excessive redactions from a memo written by Democrats to rebut GOP assertions that the FBI unlawfully spied on a Trump campaign adviser.
Rep. Adam Schiff said FBI and Justice Department officials have flagged ""everything that isn't already a matter of public record"" from the memo, whose release President Donald Trump blocked last week on national security grounds.
Story Continued Below
Trump agreed earlier this month to declassify a Republican memo that suggests wrongdoing by senior FBI officials, which Democrats called misleading and a diversion from the federal probe into Trump’s Russia ties.
Speaking at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast in Washington, Schiff speculated that ""the White House must have asked"" the FBI and Justice Department to raise these broad concerns.
Complaining that the officials’ requests would leave little of value in the memo, Schiff urged a focus on “redactions that are necessary to protect sources and methods.”
Trump directed the Justice Department to work with Democrats to see whether portions of the memo could be released without jeopardizing intelligence sources and methods.

Schiff said the goal of the FBI review of his memo shouldn’t be to strike all classified material — which was drawn from sensitive intelligence files — but to determine which information can safely be released.
Schiff noted that the House Intelligence Committee had already voted on the question last week.
“The committee voted to declassify all of this,"" the California Democrat said.
Schiff's comments on the FBI's pushback to his memo is the clearest window yet into what revisions and redactions the FBI and the Trump White House are seeking in order to support release of the Democratic memo.
Trump recently approved the release of the classified Republican memo over the objection of his own FBI director, Christopher Wray, who also opposed releasing the Democratic memo without redactions.
Schiff emphasized that the FBI hadn't objected to the facts in the Democratic memo and said that everything the bureau wanted removed from his memo would have provided facts that the GOP memo excluded.
""I think the question ought to be, is there anything that can’t be declassified in the public interest because [of] sources and methods and investigative interests,"" he said. ""We’re trying to identify that very narrow subset that we can redact. So, in our view, even looking at what the FBI has identified as still classified, a lot of that is already in the public domain.""
The GOP memo argued that the FBI misled a secret court to obtain a warrant to spy on Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, who was suspected of having improper ties to Russian government officials. According to the Republican document, the FBI relied on a dossier compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, to obtain the warrant on Page. Steele compiled his dossier for a firm that had been hired by the campaign of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee to investigate Trump's international business relationships.",UNDEFINED
191100,Breitbart,"Tom Steyer: To Win Midterms, Democrats Must Promise to Impeach Trump","Left-wing billionaire Tom Steyer is spending tens of millions of dollars on advertising urging that President Donald Trump be impeached — because he thinks it is the only way for Democrats to win the 2018 midterm elections.
The Los Angeles Times reports:
Tom Steyer, who has given tens of millions to Democratic candidates and causes, believes the party’s best hope is turning November into a referendum on Trump’s ouster; it’s the only way, the San Francisco hedge-fund billionaire insists, to engage voters who see little difference between the two major parties, or who’ve given up on politics because nothing in Washington ever seems to change. “We lose election after election as a result of this,” said Kevin Mack, a strategist for Steyer and his political organization, Need to Impeach, which is crusading nationwide to get every Democratic candidate to commit to impeachment. In the meantime, according to the organization, more than 5 million people have signed a petition in support.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who hopes to become Speaker again if Democrats regain their majority in November, has tried to discourage talk of impeachment — at least until after the election.
But other Democrats are campaigning on the issue.
In a re-eleciton ad, Rep. Michael Capuano (D-MA) touts his two votes to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump:
Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), who called on the public to “harass” members of the Trump administration this weekend, also renewed her call to impeach the president.

75777,Fox News,"Larry Kudlow accepts job of White House National Economic Council director, replaces Gary Cohn","Conservative commentator and former Reagan administration official Larry Kudlow has accepted the job of White House National Economic Council director, replacing Gary Cohn, Fox News has learned.
President Trump offered Kudlow the job just one week after Cohn resigned from his post as the president’s chief economic adviser, a senior administration official told Fox News.
“Larry Kudlow was offered, and accepted, the position of Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement Wednesday. ""We will work to have an orderly transition and will keep everyone posted on the timing of him officially assuming the role.”
Kudlow’s extensive career in finance includes stints working for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and serving as a chief economist and senior managing director at Bear Stearns, the defunct investment bank that failed during the 2008 financial crisis.
Kudlow served as the associate director for economics and
planning in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during former President Ronald Reagan’s first term.
Kudlow is now a CNBC senior contributor and was previously the host of CNBC's prime-time ""The Kudlow Report.""
Cohn resigned amid opposition to the president’s decision to announce tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum. Hours before his resignation, Trump set a “line in the sand” asking Cohn if he would support the new policy, and Cohn did not answer, a White House official and an outside adviser to the president told Fox News.
Kudlow, who advised Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, also was against the idea of tariffs, writing an op-ed against Trump’s plan, calling it a “crisis of logic.”
The president this week reportedly acknowledged that he and Kudlow “don’t agree on everything,” but welcomes having a difference of opinion among his close advisers.
Just last week, the president said “I like conflict.”
“I like having two people with different points of view. And I certainly have that,” Trump said. “And then I make a decision. But I like watching it. I like seeing it. And I think it’s the best way to go.”
But Kudlow has praised the president’s work on tax reform, writing last year that, “Trump and the GOP are on the side of the growth angels with the passage of powerful tax-cut legislation to boost business investment, wages, and take-home family pay. The Democrats, meanwhile, are left with stale class-warfare slogans about tax cuts for the rich.”

Even as President Trump tries to quiet speculation that Scott Pruitt’s days in his administration are numbered, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency continues to become a bigger political liability for him.
Now the federal government’s top ethics officer is calling for the EPA to take action addressing Pruitt’s multiple alleged ethics lapses. The letter sent to the EPA from David Apol, acting director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, was notable because such letters are rarely written from Apol’s office.

Like other large, diverse democracies, Canada has learned that it is not immune to random atrocities. Four years ago, a gunman walked into Parliament in Ottawa, hunting politicians. He murdered a guard before he was killed.
What was striking in Monday's van attack, which killed 10 people and injured 14, was the public response: a mix of shock and incredulity tempered by reserve and order. Politicians of all stripes were calm. The media was careful. The police were disciplined. And the people were unfazed.
Instead of hysteria, accusation and anger, there were sorrow and sympathy. No xenophobic calls for vigilantism or limits on freedom. It was an extraordinary exercise in restraint -- a particularly Canadian response.
The misfit in a white rental van who sped down the crowded streets of north Toronto attacked the country's largest and most diverse city. Toronto -- more than half of whose 6.4 million residents were born abroad -- had never seen that kind of carnage.

Several House Democratic veterans Friday lambasted President Donald Trump’s use of Twitter to signal a potential attack on Syria, charging the commander in chief’s use of social media undermines national security and endangers U.S. troops.
“The president’s behavior is both reckless and irresponsible. It endangers the lives of our men and women in uniform,” Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) said during a Capitol Hill news conference.

Trump, he added, “must stop these public provocations immediately.”
Trump appeared to telegraph a retaliatory strike against the Syrian regime of Bashar Assad for its use of chemical weapons, tweeting on Wednesday that missiles ""will be coming, nice new and 'smart!'"" But Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told lawmakers Thursday that no decision had yet been made on Syria.
Asked how lawmakers could reconcile Trump’s tweets with Mattis’ testimony, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said, “It’s easy. The president’s a horrible president.”
“He doesn’t know how to govern. … He just spouts at the mouth like a drunkard,” Gallego said. “That’s the reality of what we’re dealing with.”

Gallego also criticized Mattis’ assertion the administration has the legal authority to strike Syria. He called for congressional votes to authorize military action, but predicted Republican leaders wouldn't act.
“He should come back and talk to us when it comes to authorizations of war and more actions in Syria,” Gallego said. “I think, unfortunately, you’re going to see the same old [House Speaker Paul] Ryan that we’ve had before, someone that’s not going to be standing up to the president.”",UNDEFINED
72802,The New York Times,"Conceding to N.R.A., Trump Abandons Brief Gun Control Promise","“Not much political support (to put it mildly),” Mr. Trump said of the higher age limit in a tweet, adding that his administration will watch court rulings before it acts. (He did not mention that it is the N.R.A. that is precipitating such court rulings by suing the State of Florida over its new gun purchasing age.)
The president’s retreat is a stark reminder — if anyone in Washington needed one — that the gun debate remains stuck where it has been for more than a decade. Despite scores of deaths from mass shootings in that time, Republican lawmakers fear the N.R.A.’s ability to stir up opposition in their districts. They continue to oppose new gun restrictions, and even a Republican president with an unconventional approach is unlikely to challenge the status quo in an election year.
“I think it is a really disappointing retreat after all the reality-show rhetoric,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview on Monday. Mr. Blumenthal, whose represents the state where 20 children were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School, said the president “has taken his plan from the N.R.A. playbook.”
In the face of N.R.A. opposition, the president has also retreated from his earlier openness to expanded background checks and a renewal of the expired ban on assault weapons — positions that he signaled during a remarkable meeting with lawmakers in which he demanded “comprehensive” legislation that would include longstanding Democratic efforts to restrict firearms.
Instead, Mr. Trump over the weekend released a modest plan that eschewed gun control measures in favor of more limited bills that would provide weapons training for teachers and create a commission to study other responses to school shootings.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Monday that the president still supported the idea of raising the minimum age for purchasing rifles, but was only committing to studying the issue because “you can’t just decide you want laws to pass.”

Ms. Feinstein, who has long pushed for a ban on assault weapons, had looked giddy at the president’s meeting with lawmakers when Mr. Trump seemed open to new legislation to restrict the sale of the weapons. On Monday, she accused the president of having “completely caved to the gun lobby.”
The idea of arming teachers is vigorously opposed by many members of both parties, law enforcement officials and groups representing the nation’s teachers. But it has been pushed for years by the N.R.A., which argues that arming school officials is the best way to protect students and teachers against a well-armed attacker. “The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun,” the N.R.A. mantra has gone.
The White House on Sunday proposed creating the Federal Commission on School Safety, which would study the question of raising the minimum age for purchasing rifles. That proposal came just a day after Mr. Trump himself mocked the idea of federal commissions as ineffective.
“We can’t just keep setting up blue-ribbon committees,” Mr. Trump said during a political rally on Saturday. The president said that members of such commissions do little more than “talk, talk, talk” and then, “two hours later, then they write a report.”
On Capitol Hill, the energy has largely dissipated for the kind of expansive gun control legislation that Mr. Trump appeared to support earlier this month. With such legislation stalled, Republican leaders are instead turning their attention toward less contentious measures that would beef up security at the nation’s schools.

The only gun-related measure that appears to stand a chance of passage this year is the so-called Fix NICS Act, a narrow N.R.A.-backed bill that would improve data reporting to the national background check database. The House has already passed it, as part of a broader bill that includes one of the N.R.A.’s highest priorities: a sharp expansion of the right to carry concealed weapons almost anywhere in the country.
The Senate’s chief sponsor of Fix NICS, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chamber’s No. 2 Republican, said in an interview last week that he had not spoken to the N.R.A. about it. He sees the bill as a way to bridge the partisan divide, though critics note that it would only enforce existing law.
“It really to me is simple,” Mr. Cornyn said. “Do people want their whole laundry list of things done and end up empty-handed? That’s what usually happens. If you say, ‘I want 100 percent of what I want or nothing,’ we invariably end up with nothing.”

But even Fix NICS is stuck. The bill has 61 co-sponsors in addition to Mr. Cornyn — two more than the 60 votes required to break a Senate filibuster. But at least two Republicans, and possibly a third, are blocking the Republican leadership from bringing the bill to the floor quickly for a vote.
School safety measures, meanwhile, are moving forward. The Republican-controlled House is expected to vote Wednesday on the STOP School Violence Act, which would authorize $50 million annually for safety improvements, including training teachers and students in how to prevent violence and developing anonymous reporting systems for threats of school violence.
In the Senate, a companion bill would also give schools money for physical improvements, such as metal detectors or bulletproof windows and doors.
And even if Senate leaders were inclined to bring up gun legislation for a vote, they are short on time. This week, the Senate is considering a measure to ease banking regulations, and next week senators will be working against a deadline to pass a catchall spending measure to fund the government; the current spending bill expires on March 23. After that, the Senate will be in recess for two weeks.",LEFT
190755,ABC News,Medical milestone: US OKs marijuana-based drug for seizures,"U.S. health regulators on Monday approved the first prescription drug made from marijuana, a milestone that could spur more research into a drug that remains illegal under federal law, despite growing legalization for recreational and medical use.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the medication, called Epidiolex, to treat two rare forms of epilepsy that begin in childhood. But it's not quite medical marijuana.
The strawberry-flavored syrup is a purified form of a chemical ingredient found in the cannabis plant — but not the one that gets users high. It's not yet clear why the ingredient, called cannabidiol, or CBD, reduces seizures in some people with epilepsy.
British drugmaker GW Pharmaceuticals studied the drug in more than 500 children and adults with hard-to-treat seizures, overcoming numerous legal hurdles that have long stymied research into cannabis.
FDA officials said the drug reduced seizures when combined with older epilepsy drugs.
The FDA has previously approved synthetic versions of another cannabis ingredient for medical use, including severe weight loss in patients with HIV.
Epidiolex is essentially a pharmaceutical-grade version CBD oil, which some parents already use to treat children with epilepsy. CBD is one of more than 100 chemicals found in marijuana. But it doesn't contain THC, the ingredient that gives marijuana its mind-altering effect.
Physicians say it's important to have a consistent, government-regulated version.
""I'm really happy we have a product that will be much cleaner and one that I know what it is,"" said Dr. Ellaine Wirrell, director of the Mayo Clinic's program for childhood epilepsy. ""In the artisanal products there's often a huge variation in doses from bottle to bottle depending on where you get it.""
Side effects with the drug include diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue and sleep problems.
Several years ago, Allison Hendershot considered relocating her family to Colorado, one of the first states to legalize marijuana and home to a large network of CBD producers and providers. Her 13-year-old daughter, Molly, has suffered from severe seizures since she was 4 months old. But then Hendershot learned about a trial of Epidiolex at New York University.
""I preferred this to some of those other options because it's is a commercial product that has gone through rigorous testing,"" said Hendershot, who lives in Rochester, New York.
Since receiving Epidiolex, Hendershot says her daughter has been able to concentrate more and has had fewer ""drop"" seizures — in which her entire body goes limp and collapses.
CBD oil is currently sold online and in specialty shops across the U.S., though its legal status remains murky. Most producers say their oil is made from hemp, a plant in the cannabis family that contains little THC and can be legally farmed in a number of states for clothing, food and other uses.
The immediate impact of Monday's approval on these products is unclear.
FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb suggested the agency would be scrutinizing CBD products with ""uncertain dosages and formulations.""
""We are prepared to take action when we see the illegal marketing of CBD-containing products with serious, unproven medical claims,"" Gottlieb said in a statement.
The FDA previously issued warnings to CBD producers that claimed their products could treat specific diseases, such as cancer or Alzheimer's. Only products that have received formal FDA approval can make such claims, typically requiring clinical trials costing millions.
Most CBD producers sidestep the issue by making only broad claims about general health and well-being.
Industry supporters downplayed the impact of the FDA approval.
""I don't know a mom or dad in their right mind who is going to change what's already working,"" said Heather Jackson, CEO of Realm of Caring, a charitable group affiliated with Colorado-based CW Hemp, one of nation's largest CBD companies. ""I really don't think it's going to affect us much.""
Jackson's group estimates the typical family using CBD to treat childhood epilepsy spends about $1,800 per year on the substance.
A GW Pharmaceuticals spokeswoman said the company would not immediately announce a price for the drug, which it expects to launch in the fall. Wall Street analysts have previously predicted it could cost $25,000 per year, with annual sales eventually reaching $1 billion.
For their part, GW Pharmaceuticals executives say they are not trying to disrupt products already on the market. The company has pushed legislation in several states to make sure its drug can be legally sold and prescribed.
The FDA approval for Epidiolex is technically limited to patients with Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, two rare forms of epilepsy for which there are few treatments. But doctors will have the option to prescribe it for other uses.
The new medication enters an increasingly complicated legal environment for marijuana.
Nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use. Another 20 states allow medical marijuana, but the U.S. government continues to classify it as a controlled substance with no medical use, in the same category as heroin and LSD.
Despite increasing acceptance, there is little rigorous research on the benefits and harms of marijuana. Last year a government-commissioned group concluded that the lack of scientific information about marijuana and CBD poses a risk to public health.
Before sales of Epidiolex can begin, the Drug Enforcement Administration must formally reclassify CBD into a different category of drugs that have federal medical approval.
GW Pharmaceuticals makes the drug in the U.K. from cannabis plants that are specially bred to contain high levels of CBD. And the company plans to continue importing the medicine, bypassing onerous U.S. regulations on manufacturing restricted substances.

112512,Breitbart,Report: Amazon Warehouse Employees 'Pee into Bottles' Due to Fear of Being Sanctioned for Toilet Breaks,"During an undercover investigation, an author documented Amazon warehouse employees peeing into bottles due to their fears of being sanctioned for taking toilet breaks.
“For those of us who worked on the top floor, the closest toilets were down four flights of stairs,” claimed author James Bloodworth. “People just peed in bottles because they lived in fear of being ­disciplined over ‘idle time’ and ­losing their jobs just because they needed the loo.”
Bloodworth’s claims were corroborated by responses to a survey of Amazon workers.
“[Targets] have increased dramatically. I do not drink water because I do not have time to go to the toilet,” declared one response.
Another employee claimed, “The target grows every year. I do not have two more legs yet to make the 100% to pick, where you actually need to run and go to the toilet just during the break,” while other employees even admitted to not drinking water throughout their work shift for fear of having to use the toilet.
Last year, another undercover investigation revealed that Amazon warehouse employees were worked to exhaustion, causing employees to pass out at work.
“Their toilet breaks are timed, and the (reportedly disgusting and ill-maintained) toilets are over a quarter mile away within the vast complex,” reported the Mirror’s Alan Selby in November. “Inactivity at the station is timed, even for those breaks, so employees are often forced to keep themselves from even going to the bathroom, lest it take too long.”
Amazon was recently granted patents for employee wristbands, which would “pinpoint the location of warehouse employees and track their hand movements in real time,” while also telling employees where to go.

183935,The Guardian,New Lords defeat for government on Brexit 'meaningful vote' amendment,"The government has been defeated in a landslide Lords vote which will set up another Commons showdown over an amendment to give MPs a “meaningful vote” even if the government fails to reach a Brexit deal.
The House of Lords voted in favour of a new amendment, devised by Tory MP and pro-EU rebel Dominic Grieve and tabled by Viscount Hailsham, by a significantly bigger margin than the last time the issue was debated. The amendment was passed by 354 votes to 235 – a majority of 119.
Michael Heseltine, Chris Patten and Sayeeda Warsi were among the 22 Tory peers who rebelled and backed the amendment.
Hailsham, the former Conservative cabinet minister Douglas Hogg, tabled the last-minute amendment on Monday morning, based on the deal Grieve believed he had struck with the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, in order to avert a government defeat in the Commons by pro-EU Tories.
Grieve said later he was double-crossed and the government went back on the agreement they had reached. Ministers tabled an amendment that would mean a vote only on a neutral motion, which would give MPs no power to halt a cliff-edge Brexit – a change that Grieve said meant the compromise was unacceptable.

Hailsham tabled an amendment which he said was based on the original deal, dubbed “Grieve 2”, which he said would give MPs the chance to vote in parliament, even in the event of “no deal”.
Speaking in the House of Lords, Hailsham said: “I am asking your lordships to make a decision to enable a House of Commons to vote on what Mr Grieve believes was agreed with the government.”
Hailsham said Grieve was a man “of the utmost personal and professional integrity” and said he accepted his version of events “without reservation”. He said the government’s offer “not only fails to deliver a promised ‘meaningful vote’... but is far worse. It is seeking to make it impossible. It deliberately removes the possibility.”
Under the new amendment, ministers must update parliament by 21 January 2019 if there is no prospect of a deal with the EU and then have two weeks to return to the House of Commons with a statement on how the government plans to proceed. MPs would then be given a vote on whether to approve the action in statement.
The Commons will vote on the revised amendment on Wednesday, though government sources have said they are confident Tory rebels do not have the numbers for it to pass.
'We're not Brexit rebels, we're pragmatic leavers,' says Tory MP Read more
The House of Lords leader, Natalie Evans, had urged peers to reject the amendment. “It is not right that your lordships’ house could have a veto on the deal simply by refusing to consider a motion,” she said, saying the alternative amendment by Hailsham contained “major flaws”.
Several former Tory cabinet ministers also spoke out against the amendment. Former leader Michael Howard said the amendment “would be to confer upon parliament a negotiation power which has always resided in the hands of the executive in our country”.
Former chancellor Norman Lamont said the amendment was unnecessary because parliament would always have the power to act in the event of no deal. “Obviously it would come to parliament, obviously it would be a major event,” he said. “Do we really have to write it down with all these complicated provisions?”

The meaningful vote is now the only unresolved issue after peers agreed not to pursue further challenges on other key issues such as membership of a customs union. At the report stage of the bill, peers inflicted 15 defeats on the government.
Angela Smith, Labour’s leader in the House of Lords, defended the scrutiny that the EU withdrawal bill had come under, calling the original legislation “deeply flawed and divisive”.
“We’ve seen a fair bit of sabre rattling from some of the most enthusiastic of Brexiteers and supporters,” she said, saying the drama did “nothing to improve the quality of debate or journalistic integrity”.
Smith said she did not believe the Lords should engage in extensive “ping pong” between the Lords and the Commons lightly, but said matters are “clearly and obviously unresolved in the House of Commons”.",LEFT

57530,The Guardian,Florida shooting survivors have a voice because they believe in change,"Anyone who has attempted public speaking, especially to make a contrary point in a room full of unsympathetic ears, will know that however much you prepare, there is a moment where you just have to jump on to the live wire of the moment, when your mouth starts to run while your brain fades to white.
That is what is so rousing about the speeches and media appearances made by the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school since the mass shooting in Florida earlier this month. In nearly all of them their voices are breaking, they scream with rage, then they pause to gulp air and weep. They are riding the thinnest crest of a wave between abject grief, righteous anger and political will, seeming at any point as if they may by dumped by the weight of their own emotion. Yet despite this, they are able to argue their case in simple terms and identify the weakest link in the oft-perfected Republican script following a mass shooting.
Perhaps the most crucial thing that makes them effective advocates for change is the belief that change is possible
At a televised debate, for example, when Marco Rubio tried his usual “this is a tough issue, gun control won’t stop someone like this” spiel, student Cameron Kasky was meticulous. He first lavished praise on the senator for showing up and then asked him, repeatedly, whether he would refuse money from the NRA. It immediately exposed Rubio’s fraudulence, using sympathetic language with the students while still taking donations from rabid gun advocates. Rubio couldn’t find a workable response as jeers rang round the stadium.
Most shootings like this stay in the news for a few days, normally accompanied by a half-hearted gun control debate, before falling further and further down homepages. So how have these students been able to progress this issue when so many before them have failed?
Part of the reason is demographics: none of the children killed in the Sandy Hook school shooting of 2012 were over seven years old; these are middle-class students preparing for college. Their school was a place where political debate was encouraged, and there had been plenty of on-campus debates about gun rights when it was still an abstract issue for most of the students.
Of course, many of America’s most effective pieces of activism have come from its most disenfranchised citizens, but as Trevor Noah, host of the Daily Show, put it: “A lot of these kids come from wealthy backgrounds. The school in Parkland is in an affluent neighbourhood … This is people using their privilege, if that makes sense. Because these kids are like, ‘No, I don’t accept this world.’ And the parents and the politicians are like, ‘Well that’s not how it works.’ And they’re like, ‘Well you need to change it. I don’t care. I want to see the manager.’”
Both the media and the students themselves have suggested that the reason they’re being listened to is because they have grown up digital natives and they have been able to harness the power of social media. While it’s true that internet access will have exposed them to the power and techniques of activism, it does these teenagers a disservice to say they are merely wily online operatives. If anything, their success has been to avoid keeping protest inside echo chambers on Twitter and Snapchat, and reach out to normal Americans on TV news and mainstream shows like Ellen and the Today Show. Even in Britain, they have been a constant feature of Radio 4 news shows and the evening news on every channel. They have shrewdly understood that all media outlets are all hungry for access to the victims, and if they are willing to sacrifice their right to private grieving, there will not be a shortage of places willing to give them a platform.
Another smart move was to set the date of their planned nationwide anti-gun protest more than a month after the shooting, giving the story an extended news cycle and infuriating the gun lobby which had hoped that national anger would dissipate as it had in the past.
But perhaps the most crucial thing that makes them effective advocates for change is the basic belief that change is possible. One of the defining malaises of our age is the feeling that we can do nothing about the horrors we are exposed to every day. The American psychologist Martin Seligman called it “learned helplessness”, the documentarian Adam Curtis called it “oh dearism” – it is a feeling that intensifies over decades of repeated failures: if you have seen enough cases of police brutality, or horrifying wars in the Middle East or mass shootings you start to believe that nothing will ever change.
These students are not only too young to have lived through the many times this has happened before, they have also grown up in an era of radical change: the first black president, the first president with no political experience, the legalisation of gay marriage and, yes, the rise of social media and its ability to give a voice to anyone. They have not yet succumbed to the idea that nothing can be done.

One of their most popular chants, heard at rallies and vigils, ringing around the American news channels and no doubt in the White House, is “we have a voice”. On paper it seems like an odd phrase: it’s non-specific, it doesn’t demand anything of any power like most protest slogans do. But when you see it spat from the mouths of otherwise peaceful young people, you realise it’s not aimed at any one lawmaker, but the fabric of reality itself.
These survivors are experiencing their agency, destroying the very deep psychological barrier that says no person can change certain inalienable truths about American politics, reminding themselves that every great change in history happened just after a thousand missed opportunities when things stayed exactly the same.

66813,Fox News,Soldier's Medal awarded to Special Forces member who saved 2 lives in North Carolina,"A Special Forces soldier stationed at Fort Bragg received the Army’s highest honor for heroism outside of combat this week.
The service member, identified only as Staff Sgt. Adams, received the Soldier’s Medal after saving the lives of two people who were involved in a fiery crash in North Carolina in October 2016, the Fayetteville Observer reported.
""It takes a special person to do what he did,"" said Army Maj. Crocker, acting commander of the 1st Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group.
Adams, part of that group, was not identified by his first name because of the nature of his job.
""Staff Sgt. Adams saw four of his fellow human beings in desperate need of help,"" Crocker said. “And in trying to save them, proved that the Army's ""capacity to do good in this world is not limited to the battlefield.""
""Staff Sgt. Adams saw four of his fellow human beings in desperate need of help. And in trying to save them, proved that the Army's capacity to do good in this world is not limited to the battlefield."" - Maj. Crocker, acting commander of the 1st Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group
Officials said the Soldier's Medal requires that a soldier must also voluntarily risk his own life to save others, the Observer reported.
Adams was traveling on the U.S. 64 highway near Asheboro, N.C., when he saw a truck with two women and two children veer down a hill and collide with several trees, the report said.
He ran to vehicle, losing his shoes on the way, and didn’t stop even as glass pierced and stuck to the soles of his feet, the Observer reported.
Adams freed and saved two of the victims, Lillie Mingin, 33, and her son Eric Mason Mingin, 7, the report said.
Brittany Goodman, 26, was ejected from the vehicle and was pronounced dead at the scene, while Colby Springle, 12, the other son of Mingin, was trapped in the vehicle and died shortly after he was extracted, the newspaper reported.
Many people say they would risk their lives to save others, but Brig. Gen. Richard Angle said Adams is one of the few who proved that he would, the Observer reported.
""My challenge to all of you ... use (Staff Sgt. Adams) and his actions as an example,"" Angle said. ""Make that decision to do the right thing. No matter how big or how small the act.""
Meanwhile, about 250 paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division’s 1st Brigade Combat Team arrived home Tuesday from Afghanistan, the Observer reported.
""Job well done,"" Col. Brett Funck, chief of staff for the 82nd Airborne Division, told the troops, according to the newspaper.
“As you come back, take a deep breath, relax, look after your paratrooper, your buddy, your jump buddy, but spend some well-deserved time with your family.”

167154,The Guardian,When the sweet turns sour: Queensland split between sugar and solar,"As solar farms spread across the central agricultural regions of the sunshine state, opponents are becoming increasingly vocal
Colin Ash has spent a working lifetime in the cane fields near the Pioneer River in central Queensland, out past Marian, where the mill has processed sugar for more than 130 years.
“You can’t get sentimental about things,” he says from the front seat of his truck as he drives slowly around the boundary of his property. “You’ve got to pay your bills.”
Almost two years ago Ash agreed to allow a solar energy company, Esco Pacific, to lease 169 hectares – about half his land – to build a solar farm of about 180,000 panels.
The scenario is increasingly common as renewables projects spread across the sunshine state, in some cases swallowing large parcels of productive agricultural land. Clean energy offers billions in potential investment and thousands of jobs for regional Queensland. But it also faces on-the-ground challenges, including turf wars with intensive farming that threaten to hamper the energy sector’s transition.

Ash’s decision to offer up part of his Mirani property for solar has made him something of a divisive figure locally. Two fellow growers objected, as did the company that buys and refines his cane, Mackay Sugar. Mackay regional council, whose planning officers had backed the project, voted to reject the application. Legal action is afoot.
Whenever he’s asked about the state of the sugar industry or the challenges faced by cane growers, Ash just makes a downward motion with his arm.
He wanders around his block, pointing to patches of standover cane – left unharvested from the previous season – where solar panels will ultimately be placed. He says part of the field to be given to the solar company was planted with cane just four years ago.
“If I had my time over again I wouldn’t have planted it, the way the industry has gone,” Ash says. “When [the solar plan] come around, the way the industry was going, it was going backwards and it was one way of diversifying into something that’s friendly, it’s not going to do harm.
“And if it doesn’t work, well, they’ll reinstate the ground back to how it was. You’re not putting it under cement or doing that sort of thing.”
‘It’s a very sunny place’
Modelling released by the Climate Institute last year showed Queensland had the potential to power 4m homes through renewable energy projects and create more than 7,000 jobs over the next decade, many of them in north and central Queensland where many local economies are struggling with high unemployment and the hit-and-miss legacies of mining and gas booms. The number of jobs on offer is considerably more than at Adani’s Carmichael coalmine, a project touted by many in these parts as an economic saviour.
Andrew Stock, an energy expert and councillor for the Climate Council, says about $1.6bn of renewable investment is being built in Queensland.
“Obviously ... it’s a very sunny place so solar projects both large and small, are very well suited to Queensland and north Queensland,” he says. “The amount of energy they can generate ... is among the highest output of any solar farms in Australia.”
The clean energy regulator says the government’s 2020 renewable energy target has effectively been met by projects either built or under construction. Incentives have led to an industry boom but there is a danger it will shift to bust without changes to policy settings and planning regulations that could threaten the pace of the renewable transition.
Stock says the federal government’s national energy guarantee is “woefully inadequate” and will bring forward no new renewable energy capacity over the next decade.
“If electricity demand doesn’t grow, and no existing coal plants shut, the modelling by the energy security board last year shows there are virtually no new renewables ... that need to be built,” he says.
“And that’s potentially a problem for renewables, that pipeline of investment projects, probably between $7bn to $10bn worth of investment, many thousands of jobs ... and that’s all put at risk because under the Neg, the emissions reduction requirements mean that there’s virtually no new renewable capacity that’s needed.”
From overhead, the cane fields are a mesmerising combination of bright green and right angles, stretching for country miles. About 300km to the north of Mirani, near the banks of the Burdekin River, patterned rows of black panels suddenly consume the landscape.
The Clare solar farm is the state’s largest, and last month was connected to the energy grid. In 2015 it caused angst among cane growers and was subject to a legal challenge led by the local milling company, Wilmar, until being “called in” by the state government, a process that overrides local planners on matters of state significance.
The same conflict between sugar and solar has been repeated at Mirani, and will be again.
“The Queensland government has a very strong policy of supporting solar renewables in general,” says Georgina Davis, senior policy adviser for the Queensland Farmers’ Federation. “They didn’t make provision to plan where they would go. They’ve let that be a market-driven process.
“It’s just been an unfortunate sort of effect that some of those sites have been on [good quality] agricultural land. Their primary focus is looking for a piece of land that has a willing seller or a willing renter, and that has the access to infrastructure they need.”

Solar projects are more efficient, and more profitable, the closer they are built to existing substations, which means proponents have targeted certain blocks. The Australian Energy Market Operator issues ratings called “marginal loss factors” which score renewable projects based on local demand and effectively determine how much energy that project can feed into the grid.
“The adoption and interest in large-scale solar has been so quick, and it has had to be quick,” Davis says. “A lot of them have been in a rush to get these facilities up compared to their competitors ... Once that capacity is gone, it’s gone.”
Although the operation of the energy market has exacerbated land-use conflicts, planning policies also lack consistency when it comes to land disputes between agriculture and renewables.
The Queensland state planning policy lists enabling renewable energy projects as a priority. It also aims to minimise “encroachment on agricultural resources to ensure viable tracts of agricultural land are maintained”.
The farmers’ federation and the farm lobby group AgForce have called for a solar code that provides protection for high-quality land and establishes rehabilitation bonds, similar to those for mining tenements. Graziers are worried about the effect of power lines connecting some facilities, and farmers are in some cases uncomfortable that they are close to projects.
‘The industry has got a lot to prove yet’
The Mackay mayor, Greg Williamson, says his council would have supported a solar farm proposal had it been on “rubbish land” but state policies required it to consider the agricultural impacts.
“It doesn’t matter whether it’s the one that’s being contested now or not,” he says. “If it’s growing 9,000 to 10,000 tonne of cane a year and it [is good quality agricultural land], we’re obliged to consider that. And really nothing else trumps it.”
Even if state government policy did not mandate the consideration of agricultural land, the council’s priority is sugar, rather than solar, Williamson says. The council has “nothing against solar” and considered building its own solar farm, but found ultimately it would not produce savings to justify the investment. Instead, the region is putting panels at individual council sites.
“We don’t want a future for our industry to be less cane farms and to grow solar panels,” he says. “We want more sugar to be produced. We want to grow more sugar for the right outcomes.”
Stock says communities such as Mackay, which is a hub for the Bowen basin’s coalmines, should be among the first to embrace the opportunities provided by renewables. They should “start to plan that transition in an orderly way so they don’t end up being faced with really quite dramatic shocks to regional employment when mines close”.
Williamson, who argues that Australia should have invested in new coal-fired power stations, bristles at that suggestion.
“Well, mate, hang on,” he says. “Queensland generates 14.8 gigawatts of power to run every day and less than 5% has been generated by solar. The industry has got a lot to prove yet.
“From a council perspective, we have an industry [sugar] that produces $400m to $500m a year for our valley, for our region ... It is not fair to level at council a head-in-the-sand attitude about renewable energy ... when we have a vested interest in protecting an industry that provides millions and millions of dollars to this district.”
For Colin Ash, that same industry, the one he’s worked in for a lifetime, is getting to the point where he’s struggling to make ends meet. Like many other growers he has everything – his income, and his ability to fund his retirement – invested in the land.
“It’s not a goldmine what they’re offering [for the solar development],” he says. “When this come along, that was one way of putting a bit of a buffer in there, without the cost of diversifying into something else.
“It was clean, green, and no trouble to go back to any other agriculture afterwards if it doesn’t work.
“You just can’t get sentimental about these things.”",LEFT

164143,Breitbart,Denmark Passes Law Banning Islamic Niqab and Burqa Face Veils,"The traditional Islamic burqa and niqab veils have been banned in Denmark after a majority vote in the country’s parliament.
In a 75-30 vote with 74 absentees on Thursday, Danish lawmakers approved the law. The Danish government says it is not aimed at any religions and does not ban headscarves, turbans or the traditional Jewish skull cap, AP reports.
Denmark now follows in the footsteps of several other European countries which have also banned the full-face veil, fully or partially, including France, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Belgium, Germany, and parts of Switzerland.
During the weeks-long parliamentary procedure of the bill, the government removed a provision allowing prison sentences as potential punishment for breaking the new law. Financial penalties will instead be inforced against those who infringe on the new legislation.
Those found violating it will receive a 1,000 Krone (£119/$166) fine which could increase to as much as £900/$1,257 for repeat offenders. Anyone forcing a person to wear garments covering the face by using force or threats can be fined or face up to two years in prison.
Justice Minister Søren Pape Poulsen has previously stated that Danish police will not forcibly remove veils from women.
“I do not want police officers pulling items of clothing off people – burqas or otherwise. That is not going to happen,” Poulsen told Politiken last month.
“If they live nearby, they will be asked to go home,” Poulsen said at the time.
A further option would be for women to be accompanied to a police station, where they would be collected by a family member, he added.
Unlike the Austrian burqa ban, which prohibits all facial coverings including Halloween costumes, the Danish ban will have a limited number of exceptions including those using scarves to protect their faces from cold and people dressed up in costume.
Following the Danish vote, Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International’s Europe Director, said: “All women should be free to dress as they please and to wear clothing that expresses their identity or beliefs. This ban will have a particularly negative impact on Muslim women who choose to wear the niqab or burqa.",RIGHT
123020,Breitbart,Five Students Shot During Cartel Attack on Mexican Border State High School,"CIUDAD VICTORIA, Tamaulipas — A team of cartel gunmen stormed a public high school in Tamaulipas and began firing indiscriminately as students ran for cover. Amid the chaos, five students were shot before fleeing the area. Some witnesses claim the shooting was potentially triggered by a failed kidnapping.
The school shooting took place at the Federal High School #1 in Ciudad Victoria, where students claim a group of gunmen pulled up to the door and began spraying gunfire. Shooters then moved up and down the hallways targeting students who tried to run for cover.
The gunmen climbed into a Chevrolet Cavalier and fled toward a neighborhood called Palmar.
Emergency personnel from a government clinic across the street rushed to care for the wounded students and moved them for treatment. One of the students was identified as a male is listed in serious condition while two females and two other males are listed as stable.
Authorities tracked down three suspected gunmen and two women who are suspected of involvement. The leader of the cell was identified as 27-year-old Juan Fernando Parra Felix from Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas. The other suspected gunmen and accomplices were only identified as Ulises Francisco, Victor Manuel, Amairani, and Marcela Janeth.
The shooting is the first of its kind in Tamaulipas where cartel gunmen stage fierce gun battles that kill innocent bystanders. Ciudad Victoria is ground zero for a fierce territorial war between rival factions of Los Zetas. Cartel Del Noreste (CDN) is fighting against rival the Old School Zetas and the Gulf Cartel.

121788,CNN,Seattle's proposed tax to fight homelessness may hit Amazon hardest,"Seattle has a thriving economy and booming housing market, and is home to successful businesses like Amazon and Starbucks. But it also has a homeless crisis and an affordable housing problem.
To help alleviate both, the Seattle City Council is weighing a proposal to impose a new tax on big businesses.
The proposed tax amounts to 26 cents per working hour per employee in Seattle. That works out to roughly $540 a year for every full-time employee.
Only businesses that generate at least $20 million of annual revenue in Seattle itself would be subject to the tax.
The legislation would affect less than 3% of employers in the city, or about 585 businesses, according to Councilmember M. Lorena Gonzalez, a co-sponsor of the legislation.
Related: Good luck buying a home in Seattle
Last fall, the council rejected a similar ""head"" tax proposal that would have raised less money but would have affected more companies.
The proposed tax is expected to raise $75 million a year, three quarters of which would be used to build roughly 1,800 affordable housing units. The other quarter would be spent on emergency and shelter services for the homeless.
By 2021, the per-head tax would convert to a 0.7% payroll tax and still raise $75 million, according to materials from the Council.
Amazon could pay $20 million or more a year
The company that likely would owe the most under such a tax is Amazon, Seattle's largest private sector employer. It employs more than 45,000 people in the city. If the proposed tax goes into effect, Amazon could be subject to a head tax north of $20 million a year.
Amazon, which declined to comment on the proposal, notes that it already contributes economically in many ways to Seattle. For example, it will provide a permanent location for a shelter in one of its new office buildings by 2020. It would be run by the nonprofit Mary's Place, which already had temporary use of two vacant Amazon buildings to shelter the homeless since 2016.
Starbucks did not respond to a request for comment.
Related: Typical Amazon employee makes less than you think
Prosperous big businesses can in turn generate a lot of economic activity and revenue for their host city. And they may donate goods, services or money to critical social causes.
But the co-sponsors of the bill note that a major cause of homelessness is the higher cost of housing that results when more workers move to a city for jobs that pay more than long-time residents have been earning. And the demand to build affordable housing doesn't keep pace.
""A progressive tax on businesses most benefiting from this growth is our best option because we already rely heavily upon regressive property and sales taxes that hit everyone equally,"" Councilmember Lisa Herbold said in a statement.
Property and sales taxes are the city's main source of revenue since Seattle does not have an income tax. Businesses there also pay a business and occupancy tax.
Critics of the Council proposal, however, say it's a tax on jobs that could curb growth.
While a head tax isn't unheard of, ""they are rare, and for good reason: most cities recognize that it's not in the best interest to penalize employment,"" said Jared Wolczak, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation.
Certainly a tax that is seen as too onerous could influence a company's behavior, noted Tax Policy Center researcher Richard Auxier. But it's also true that a company locates itself in a place for more reasons than taxes, Auxier added. For instance, a business has a better chance of prospering in a socially stable city with good infrastructure, good schools and an educated workforce.",UNDEFINED
172606,Reuters,"UPDATE 1-South Africa's Eskom plans foreign bond sale, cuts capex","(Adds quotes, details)
JOHANNESBURG, June 7 (Reuters) - South African state power utility Eskom plans to sell foreign debt in around two months following an improvement in investor sentiment, its chief executive said on Thursday.
CEO Phakamani Hadebe, who was appointed permanently to the position in May, said that whereas investors and banks were not willing to lend to Eskom last year, they were now approaching their credit committees to seek approval for lending.
The struggling power firm is emerging from corporate scandals and governance issues as well as a string of interim CEO appointments stretching back to 2016.
“We are seeing an increase in appetite from investors. From July last year to January we couldn’t even sell 1 billion rand ($78 million) of debt, but the situation has changed dramatically,” Hadebe said at a briefing on Eskom’s operations.
“We plan a foreign issuance in around two months’ time.”
He said between 15 billion rand and 20 billion rand ($1.6 billion) of foreign borrowing is expected this financial year.
Eskom would reduce capital expenditure at the firm to 45 billion rand from 55 billion rand in the current financial year, he said.
Hadebe has been leading efforts to stabilise Eskom, a company at the heart of corruption scandals surrounding ousted president Jacob Zuma, as interim CEO since January after an intervention by then-Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa.
Zuma has denied any wrongdoing.
Ramaphosa, who replaced Zuma in February, has made reforming state-owned firms a priority as he seeks to bolster economic growth and stave off sovereign credit ratings downgrades.
Eskom is regularly cited by ratings agencies as one of the main threats to the country’s creditworthiness. ($1 = 12.8031 rand) (Reporting by Alexander Winning Editing by James Macharia)",CENTER

100032,Reuters,Nippon Life: lower insurance rate gives it leeway to buy JGBs,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Nippon Life Insurance Co [NPNLI.UL] said it will resume buying some Japanese government bonds (JGBs) after the insurer effectively shunned them more than two years ago when their yields became too low to meet obligations to policy holders.
“There is room now to invest in JGBs after we lowered interest rates on insurance policies,” Hiroshi Shimizu, who became president of Japan’s largest private-sector life insurer on Sunday, told Reuters.
He was referring to a cut in returns promised to policy holders of insurance products sold since April last year.
Nippon Life’s move is likely to be followed by other Japanese insurers that also reduced promised returns.
Nippon Life, which manages assets worth $626 billion, and other Japanese insurers are among the most affected by the Bank of Japan’s massive monetary easing, which has driven down yields on JGBs and other assets.
Ultra-low yields of government debt, which make up roughly 40 percent of their investment portfolio, has made it difficult for insurers to secure enough returns promised to policy holders, prompting them to seek riskier but higher-yielding assets.
Nippon Life has curbed buying JGBs since financial year ended in March 2016, when yields on 20-year and 30-year notes, tenors of choice for life insurers, fell below 1 percent. [JP20YTN=JBTC] [JP30YTN=JBTC]
Nippon Life’s holdings of JGBs stood at 19.26 trillion yen ($180.9 billion) at the end of March last year, down from 19.62 trillion yen a year earlier.
Shimizu said lower promised returns on new policies, 0.4 percent for whole life insurance for instance, allow it to buy JGBs at current yield levels. The yield on 20-year notes is around 0.505 percent.
Still, he said JGB yields remain too low for old insurance policies, which have far higher promised returns. “We are not at the stage yet to fully resume buying JGBs. We will keep shifting money to investments such as overseas assets, credit products and growth areas,” he said.
Shimizu, 57, joined Nippon Life in 1983. He is a certified actuary - a professional with mathematical expertise to calculate risks and probabilities for insurance products.
Nippon Life has become one of the most acquisitive Japanese insurers, making a string of deals at home and abroad recently.
“Our presence in North America and Europe is small. We would like to seek opportunities in these regions,” Shimizu said. “M&A remains an important strategic option.”",CENTER
16088,Breitbart,I'll 'Close My Mouth for a While',"Actor Matt Damon says he’s sorry for the anger-inducing string of comments he’s made of late, for which he was accused by many of downplaying the culture of sexual misconduct currently upending much of the entertainment world.
“I really wish I’d listened a lot more before I weighed in on this,” Damon said in an appearance Tuesday on Today “I don’t want to further anybody’s pain with anything that I do or say. So for that I am really sorry.”
In December, the Downsizing star received backlash after seemingly excusing Sen. Al Franken’s (D-MN) alleged serial sexual assault as a “terrible joke” and said he’d be able to “work with” Louis CK after the comedian admitted to masturbating in front of several women.
Those Rolling Stone interview comments were preceded by Damon’s admission to ABC News that there’s apparently “a spectrum of behavior” and that there’s “a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right?”
Damon managed to enrage more people by insisting that the “sh*tload of guys” who aren’t sexual predators aren’t getting enough credit.
Now, Damon — whose acting career was launched into superstardom, with help from disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein — says he’s going to sit down and shut up and let the women leading the anti-harassment “Time’s Up” movement do the work without him getting in the way.
“A lot of those women are my dear friends and I love them and respect them and support what they’re doing and want to be a part of that change and want to go along for the ride, but I should get in the back seat and close my mouth for a while,” he said on Today.
The wave of misconduct allegations against powerful men in Hollywood hit home with Damon, who, in October, was accused of pressuring the New York Times in 2004 to kill a story alleging sexual abuse against Weinstein.
Last month, a petition was launched demanding Damon’s cameo in the upcoming female-led heist reboot Ocean’s 8 be removed from the film. The petition, which says Damon’s role in the film is “a show of massive disrespect for the brave women speaking out, has more than 28,000 signatures.

54590,CNN,Senator questions mine safety official's industry ties,"(CNN) The man in charge of mine safety under the Trump administration is facing more scrutiny about his ties to an industry push to roll back safety regulations.
Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island has sent a letter to the assistant secretary for mine safety and health, David Zatezalo, questioning his relationship with a coal mining company leader who has called on the White House to roll back several safety rules that Zatezalo told Congress he supports keeping.
Whitehouse's letter questions Zatezalo's testimony at his October confirmation hearing, where he said he supports the current level of enforcement of the mine dust safety rule meant to reduce black lung disease cases in coal miners -- and another rule that punishes companies with repeat safety violations.
That testimony, Whitehouse says, directly contradicts an ""action plan"" sent to the White House by Bob Murray, the CEO of Murray Energy Corp., whom Zatezalo has publicly called ""one of the people whose opinion I value.""
""Over the last several months, the public has learned that Mr. Murray has been working behind the scenes actively to promote policies that would benefit his company,"" Whitehouse's letter says, making public a letter from Murray Energy addressed to Vice President Mike Pence that lays out his wish list for regulation rollbacks.
The Labor Department did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on Whitehouse's letter.
CNN has previously reported on Zatezalo's history of opposing the safety rules he now is charged with enforcing.
When Zatezalo was the CEO of Rhino Resources -- a coal company where inspectors documented more than 1,100 safety violations since 2008 -- he initiated litigation on behalf of the Ohio Coal Association against the department he now runs, challenging a rule that goes after companies with a pattern of violations.
But in a congressional hearing last month, Zatezalo said his past work for mining companies does not present a conflict of interest and he has no plans to recuse himself from decision-making on the Ohio Coal Association case that challenges those safety rules.
Whitehouse's letter asks Zatezalo to clarify whether he's made any commitments to Murray Energy since he was confirmed or if he's changed his position that he ""would not propose any reduction in the enforcement,"" as he said during his confirmation hearing.",UNDEFINED

The Border Force will re-advertise for 21 new jobs in Northern Ireland, dropping a previous requirement that candidates must have a British passport, the Home Office has said.
The Equality Commission had registered its concern that it could lead to possible discrimination by ""excluding a large section of the population"".
The Home Office has apologised for what it has said was ""an error"".
It said it should have read ""'a full and valid passport'"".
The original requirement for applicants to the Border Force to have British passports drew criticism from nationalist politicians, some of whom referred the matter to the Equality Commission.
'No eligible candidates disadvantaged'
""In view of this being brought to our attention, the decision was taken to stop the campaign, correct the wording and re-advertise,"" the Home Office added.
""This is to ensure that no eligible candidates are disadvantaged.""
Candidates who have already applied will have their applications carried over.
Anyone else interested in applying will have two weeks to do so after new adverts with corrected wording go live.",UNDEFINED
158428,ABC News,NOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this week,"A roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue headlines of the week.

NOT REAL: American Restaurant Granted Permission to Sell Dog Meat!
THE FACTS: A long-circulated false article about a California restaurant putting canine flesh on its menu offers this new twist: the sales are going forward as a court considers whether selling dishes of dog is protected in the U.S. as part of freedom of religion. But the Los Angeles County public health department says there's no such restaurant there called Puchow de Manila Eatery and Fine Dining, and they noted it's illegal in the state to sell dog meat for human consumption. The most recent version of the story, which has circulated since at least 2014, alleges an unnamed ""Filipino group"" asked an unspecified Supreme Court to lift the ban because it violated members' religious rights. The article on the grandemeli site said that in the meantime, the restaurant had ""provisional permission"" to serve the meat. The site couldn't be reached for comment, as it published no contact information and registered the page through a third-party service.

NOT REAL: The U.S. District Attorney Has Announced That He Will Be Pursuing Charges of Treason Against the Former President Barack Obama
THE FACTS: A website is recirculating an inaccurate story claiming an FBI official announced he's investigating former President Barack Obama for treason. The latest version of the story appeared on a site called webviners. It alleged FBI general counsel Dana Boente will pursue such charges, but Boente never made such an announcement. Also, the piece incorrectly identified him as ""the U.S. District Attorney."" The article also erred in claiming Obama demoted Boente at some unspecified time during his administration, removing him from a Justice Department position that was second in line behind the attorney general, and that President Donald Trump reversed that action. Obama nominated Boente in 2015 to lead federal prosecutions in Virginia's eastern district, and Boente remained in that job through the rest of Obama's term. After Trump took office in January 2017, the new president brought Boente to the Justice Department in Washington, where he has served in several senior roles. He officially left the prosecutor's job in Virginia in October. The webviners site administrators could not be reached for comment.

NOT REAL: Million Pounds Of Rat Meat Being Sold As Chicken Wings In U.S.
THE FACTS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration hasn't issued a warning to consumers about 1 million pounds of rat meat being sold as boneless chicken wings and officials didn't seize any such meat from China at the Port of San Francisco. Such claims have circulated on social media for more than a year. The latest version appeared on the Gun Society site. In an email this week, FDA spokesman Peter Cassell said the story isn't true. While the tale has been published in the past as satire, the Gun Society site didn't present it that way and did not offer contact information for a response.

178760,Breitbart,'Scam of the Century': South Korea's Conservatives Pan Trump-Kim Summit,"South Korea’s conservatives, including members of the right-wing Liberty Korea Party, have expressed dismay at President Donald Trump’s meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, decrying the lack of enforcement of any denuclearization agreement and substance in their joint declaration.
Hong Joon-pyo, the leader of the Liberty Korea Party, wrote on social media that South Korea’s security was “on the edge of a cliff” and later decried the summit as a “great failure.” The conservative outlet Hankook Ilbo, according to a translation by the Agence-France Presse (AFP), lamented the lack of language assuring “complete, verifiable, irreversible” denuclearization on Pyongyang’s part.
“In terms of the key issue … it may appear that the result failed to meet expectations,” an editorial in Hankook read, leaving the door open by noting that talks had “just begun.”
South Korea’s conservative Chosun Ilbo newspaper, in one of the most scathing condemnations of the meeting, said the summit “represents no progress and achieves nothing.”
“Over the last few months, Trump has made increasingly bombastic vows to scrap North Korea’s nuclear weapons as soon as possible, but now there is no deadline to be found anywhere, and instead Trump is talking about real estate development on North Korea’s coast,” the newspaper’s editorial board argued. “Trump gave North Korea a major gift even before it has taken any steps toward complete denuclearization. And in the joint agreement, it is Trump rather than the U.S. which is the party guaranteeing North Korea’s regime safety. This is diplomacy for the kindergarten.”
Chosun‘s editorial called the results of the meeting “the worst outcome for South Korea” and applauded Kim Jong-un’s “incredible achievement” of getting a U.S. president to meet with him without yielding any “major concessions.”
“A closer look at the joint agreement shows it was Kim who ended up taking home the prize. It is simply unbelievable that Trump flew all the way to Singapore to end up with the short end of the stick,” an outraged Chosun concludes.
In addition to its own voice, Chosun magnified that of skeptics who felt that the language in the Trump-Kim declaration was too soft to ensure that North Korea, which has serially broken international agreements, would adhere to it. Chosun has consistently throughout 2018 championed the voices of North Korean refugees and defectors who have demanded that world leaders keep the horrific human rights abuses of the Kim regime front and center in negotiations.
Several professors told Chosun Ilbo they believe the deal worsens the North Korean problem.
“With the latest agreement, we can kiss goodbye to the prospect of North Korean denuclearization,” Nam Sung-wook at Korea University told the newspaper. Park Won-gon of Handong Global University called the meeting the “scam of the century.”
The voices condemning the meeting are largely minority voices in South Korea, a fact punctuated Wednesday by regional elections that saw the ruling leftist Democratic Party sweep so definitively that Hong and other minority party leaders are expected to resign. Public sentiment about engaging Kim Jong-un has swung dramatically throughout 2018, first dropping significantly in January following the presence of a North Korean delegation at the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, then picking up after Moon Jae-in met Kim personally. By late May, 78 percent of South Korean respondents told the Korea Research Center that they trusted Kim Jong-un to make a deal on denuclearization.
The deal that Kim and Trump agreed to in Singapore Tuesday means the end of “war games” between South Korea and the United States, which often simulate the invasion of North Korea. President Trump called the exercises “provocative” and told reporters they would end, a promise he made following his meeting with Kim. South Korean government officials tentatively said Tuesday that “we need to figure out President Trump’s accurate meaning and intention of this comment.”
On Wednesday, the South Korean presidential office issued a more concrete statement, saying, “We believe there is a need to consider various ways to further promote dialogue as long as serious discussions are being held between the United States and North Korea for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and establishment of peace.”
In addition to a promise to work towards “complete” denuclearization, Kim promised in the joint declaration with Trump that he would repatriate the remains of Americans killed during the Korean War.

148296,Breitbart,2020: Trump to Jerry Brown: ‘Please Run’ for POTUS,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday encouraged California Governor Jerry Brown to challenge him in 2020 for presidency.
Trump made his remarks during a White House roundtable event in which California law enforcement officials and elected officials discussed the Golden State’s revolt against California’s sanctuary laws for illegal immigrants.
When attendees blasted Brown, who referred to anti-sanctuary politicians as “low-life” politicians, for not meeting with them, Trump said that “somebody said he is going to run for president.”
Trump then enthusiastically said: “Please run!”
As Breitbart News reported, former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown said on Tuesday that Democrats should consider Brown as a 2020 presidential nominee.
“Don’t forget Jerry Brown. No matter what age you might think Jerry Brown really is, he’s never been through the process of growing old by virtue of hard work,” Brown told Chris Matthews on MSNBC’s Hardball. “Jerry Brown is still an entity that the Democratic Party should be looking at. Period.”
Brown and Trump have traded barbs primarily on immigration-related issues in recent months. When Attorney General Jeff Sessions sued California over three of its sanctuary laws, Brown accused the Trump administration of waging “war” against the Golden State. Trump taunted “Moonbeam” Brown at a Michigan rally after Brown sent National Guardsmen to the border but prevented them from engaging in immigration enforcement.
On Wednesday, Brown accused Trump of “lying on immigration” and “lying about crime and lying about the laws of CA.”
“Flying in a dozen Republican politicians to flatter him and praise his reckless policies changes nothing,” Brown tweeted. “We, the citizens of the fifth largest economy in the world, are not impressed.”

At the roundtable event, Escondido Mayor Sam Abed accused Brown of trying to take away the American dreams of law-abiding Californians. Los Alamitos Mayor Pro Tem Warren Kusumoto and San Diego Supervisor Kristin Gaspar blasted Brown for referring to them as “low-life” politicians for opposing the state’s sanctuary laws and prioritizing the rights and concerns of citizens and legal immigrants over illegal immigrants.

President Trump endorsed Rep. Dan Donovan, R-N.Y., Wednesday, citing one of the reasons as Donovan's vote on the tax cut bill signed by Trump at the end of last year. The problem: Donovan didn't vote for the tax cut.
""There is no one better to represent the people of N.Y. and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than @RepDanDonovan, who is strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again,"" Trump tweeted. ""Dan has my full endorsement!""
In December, Donovan said that he ""wanted nothing more than to vote for a tax plan that would put more money in the pockets of overburdened taxpayers and spur job creation."" But with the elimination of various deductions, Donovan said the bill would end up raising taxes on his constituents.
""With the state and local tax deduction nearly eliminated, this tax bill doesn't equal relief for far too many New Yorkers,"" Donovan said in a statement announcing his intention to vote against the bill. ""My responsibility and allegiance is to the people who sent me here, and I will not support a tax hike on the people I represent.""
There is no one better to represent the people of N.Y. and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than @RepDanDonovan, who is strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again. Dan has my full endorsement! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2018
The incumbent Donovan is locked in a primary battle against former Republican Rep. Michael Grimm. Grimm has tried to paint Donovan as not being a strong enough backer of the president's agenda.
Despite Donovan's vote against his tax bill, Trump fears Grimm, who pleaded guilty to federal tax charges in 2014, would lose in the general election. Citing Roy Moore's loss in Alabama, Trump said, ""We can't take any chances on losing to a Nancy Pelosi controlled Democrat!""
Very importantly, @RepDanDonovan will win for the Republicans in November...and his opponent will not. Remember Alabama. We can’t take any chances on losing to a Nancy Pelosi controlled Democrat! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2018

184768,Reuters,"Russia's oil export, refinery plans point to increase in output","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Ahead of a meeting with Saudi Arabia and other producers, Russia already plans to increase oil exports, its July-September schedule shows, which coupled with increasing refinery runs suggests Moscow is gearing up to raise production.
OPEC and non-OPEC producers are scheduled to meet on June 22-23 in Vienna to discuss a possible increase in output after more than a year and a half of coordinated cuts which have taken 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) out of the market.
Those cuts, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, having helped slash global oversupply and raised prices by almost $20 a barrel, but there are now calls, from Russia’s energy minister Alexander Novak and others, that the deal be re-examined.
Crude exports and transit from Russia is expected to rise to 63.34 million tonnes in the July-September quarter from 62.45 million planned for April-June, Russia’s export schedule shows.
That works out to an increase of around 20,000 bpd - not significant in itself - but comes alongside plans by Russian refiners to raise third-quarter throughput by 2.2 million tonnes versus the second quarter, energy ministry forecasts show.
Raising both would typically require a production increase.
Under the deal among OPEC and non-OPEC producers, Russia agreed to cut production by 300,000 bpd compared to its output in October 2016.
It has exceeded its production quota for the last three months, however, pumping an average 10.97 million bpd in May - or around 20,000 bpd more than agreed, ministry data showed.
Russia could quickly add back at least 300,000 bpd of production, the ministry has said.
Top producer Rosneft could increase output by 70,000 bpd in just two days, according to analysts who have recently visited the company.",CENTER

125614,The Guardian,Parents of US student Otto Warmbier sue North Korea over his death,"Parents of 22-year-old, returned to US in a coma after being held in North Korea, say he was ‘brutally tortured and murdered’
The parents of the US college student Otto Warmbier have sued North Korea over their son’s death in 2017 following his release from captivity there, according to the lawsuit, which said their son was “brutally tortured and murdered”.
The wrongful-death suit was filed in US district court at a diplomatically delicate time, just weeks ahead of an expected meeting between the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and Donald Trump. Kim and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, also are set to meet on Friday.
Korean summit: everything you need to know Read more
“Otto was taken hostage, kept as a prisoner for political purposes, used as a pawn and singled out for exceptionally harsh and brutal treatment by Kim Jong-un,” his father, Fred Warmbier, said in a statement.
Warmbier, from Wyoming, Ohio, died at age 22 after being imprisoned in North Korea from January 2016 until he was returned to the United States in a coma. He died a few days later, and an Ohio coroner said the cause was lack of oxygen and blood to the brain.
North Korea blamed botulism and ingestion of a sleeping pill and dismissed torture claims. The coroner who examined Warmbier said he had found no sign of botulism.
The suit by Fred Warmbier and his wife, Cindy, seeks unspecified damages.
“North Korea, which is a rogue regime, took Otto hostage for its own wrongful ends and brutally tortured and murdered him,” the lawsuit said.
North Korea does not have an embassy in the United States. A representative of the North Korean mission to the UN in New York was not immediately available to comment.
Otto Warmbier, a student at the University of Virginia, was part of a travel group. When the group tried to leave North Korea after five days, he was held at the airport.
The filing says Warmbier was forced to make a false statement, confessing to invented charges that he was acting as a spy connected to the Central Intelligence Agency.
US Senate confirms CIA director Mike Pompeo as Trump's secretary of state Read more
Stewart Baker, a former assistant secretary of homeland security, said North Korea had immunity from lawsuits as a sovereign nation but still might be sued because of its US designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.
“But it’s almost impossible to collect any judgment that might be awarded. So it’s doubtful North Korea will feel sufficiently threatened by the lawsuit to upset the talks. And after all, he [Kim] can settle claims against North Korea in any US-North Korea agreement,” Baker said by email.
Kim is set to cross the heavily militarized border on Friday for the first summit with South Korea, setting the stage for him to meet with Trump in late May or early June.
Just months ago, Trump and Kim traded threats and insults during North Korea’s rapid advances in pursuit of nuclear-armed missiles capable of hitting the US.
But this month it emerged that the CIA director, Mike Pompeo, had a secret meeting with the North Korean leader as part of an effort to lay the groundwork for direct talks between Trump and Kim.
On Thursday, the US Senate confirmed Pompeo to be secretary of state, and the White House released two photographs of him shaking hands with Kim.",LEFT

164885,Fox News,Russia probe has cost taxpayers nearly $17 million since Mueller's appointment,"Taxpayers have spent nearly $17 million on the Russia probe since Special Counsel Robert Mueller took over the investigation last year, according to a new spending report released Thursday by the Justice Department.
About $10 million was spent between October and March, the document states. That includes $4.5 million spent by Mueller’s team and another $5.5 million spent by the Justice Department on other expenditures attributable to the investigations.
“The department will continue to dedicate and leverage resources to maintain strong program and financial management controls,” the DOJ said in the report. “Management takes its program and financial accountability seriously and is dedicated to ensuring that funds are used in a responsible and transparent manner.”

Acquisition of equipment - $54,597
TOTAL - $ 4,506,624
Does not include the $5.5 million spent by the Justice Department on other expenses related to the Russia probe during this time.
Mueller was appointed special counsel in May 2017 by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Previously, the Justice Department said that during the May-September 2017 period, the investigation cost nearly $7 million.
TRUMP COMPLAINS ABOUT COST OF RUSSIA PROBE
That sum included $3.2 million in direct Special Counsel expenses and $3.5 million for other DOJ expenses, covering costs like agents working on raids or interviews and other government contractors.
The spending report said these expenses would “have incurred for the investigations irrespective of the existence” of Mueller’s probe.
Earlier this month, President Trump complained on Twitter about the money being spent on the “witch hunt.”
“At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt,” Trump asked in one tweet.
Mueller is investigating Russia’s attempted interference in the 2016 election, and whether there was any collusion with Trump campaign officials. The investigation has also ensnared other Trump officials, like former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign chairman Paul Manfort, over other issues.
Trump has repeatedly said there was “no collusion.”

Enlarge this image toggle caption Anatolii Stepanov /AFP/Getty Images Anatolii Stepanov /AFP/Getty Images
The war in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russian-backed separatists has reached an impasse after more than three years of fighting that has claimed more than 10,000 lives and sparked a humanitarian crisis.
Last month, the two sides conducted one of the largest prisoner swaps since the start of the conflict in 2014, representing long-awaited movement in the stalled peace process that began with the 2015 Minsk Accords. That agreement outlined provisions for a cease-fire and other measures to resolve the conflict.
The war, which erupted after the Russian annexation of Crimea, continues to impact U.S. relations with Russia and prompt many Western leaders to question Russian President Vladimir Putin's wider intentions in Eastern Europe.
BBC correspondent Jonah Fisher describes the situation in Ukraine as ""a simmering conflict"" with no end in sight, characterized by frequent cross-border shelling.
""The front line between the Ukrainian government forces and the Russian-backed rebel forces really hasn't moved substantially over the last few years,"" he tells Here & Now's Meghna Chakrabarti. ""It's still a conflict which is being fought on the ground, but it's not a conflict really that either side seems to think it can win.""
The USS Navy destroyer Carney arrived in Ukrainian waters this week as part of American efforts to support the Ukrainian government. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, while the U.S. and Europe have not provided significant military support to Ukraine, the ongoing conflict has damaged the prospects of collaborating with Russia on terrorism, arms control and the Syrian conflict.
In December, the Trump administration announced that it would start sending lethal weapons to Ukraine to support their forces fighting in the eastern part of the country, which sparked criticism from Russia, Fisher says.
""It's pretty rich really coming from the Russians considering it's almost accepted by almost everyone that the Russians are ... providing the support and indeed much of the manpower to the rebels in the eastern part of Ukraine,"" he says. ""On the ground, it's not going to really shift the balance of power, but the Ukrainians are certainly pleased that the Americans have sort of increased their commitment to them.""
The Trump administration has sent mixed messages on Russia's role in Ukraine, but in December, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was clear about the U.S. commitment to Ukraine.
""Russia's taking sovereign territory of Ukraine is something that we will never accept,"" Tillerson said at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [OSCE] summit in Vienna. ""And we appreciate the strong solidarity of European partners in standing up on behalf of Ukraine to restore their sovereign territory to them.""
Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has blamed Ukraine for the stalemate in efforts to reach a peace agreement.
""The whole responsibility lies with Ukrainian authorities,"" he said in his speech at the OSCE.
The United Nations Human Rights Council estimates more than 1.6 million people have been internally displaced by the conflict, and for the nearly 3 million that remain living near the front lines, the humanitarian crisis is increasingly dire.
Alexander Hug, deputy chief monitor in Ukraine for OSCE, told NPR last August that those caught in the crossfire are struggling to survive with little power, heat or running water.
""They are not in tanks and in armored vehicles,"" he said. ""They are in their houses, in their beds. They are on the streets and in their gardens and they are fully exposed to these risks, and that has to be acknowledged. It is for them that this should come to an end.""
Fisher adds that some European countries also want an end to the fighting, so economic sanctions against Russia can be lifted.
""But so far there's really been no movement in particular from the rebel side or the Russian side towards actually implementing any of those agreements,"" he says. ""There appears at the moment no real road map out of this conflict.""",LEFT
60989,CNN,Stock market drops after Trump announces tariffs,"Wall Street is worried about a trade war.
The Dow dropped 420 points on Thursday after President Trump said his administration will impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 declined 1.3% apiece.
Trump's controversial tariff announcement caught investors off guard and immediately raised concerns about retaliation from China or other major U.S. trading partners.
""This is the first shot across the bow over a trade war,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR. ""And nobody wins a trade war.""
Trump said his administration would impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum. It was not immediately clear whether Trump would exempt some countries from the tariffs, as his national security advisers have urged him to do to avoid hurting U.S. allies.
Corporate America has warned Trump that tariffs could backfire. Last month, the Business Roundtable warned of the risk of ""foreign retaliation"" that would ""harm the U.S. economy.""
Investors will be looking to see how U.S. trading partners react to the tariffs.
Beyond worries about retaliation, the tariff news drove concerns about rising costs for companies that rely heavily on aluminum and steel, like auto and plane makers. Imports make up about a third of the steel American businesses use every year, and more than 90% of aluminum used here. Shares of Boeing (BA) fell 3% General Motors (GM) dipped 4%, and Ford (F) dropped 3%.
Related: NY Fed chief: Tariffs risk 'trade war'
If the tariffs result in higher prices on steel and aluminum, companies that rely on those products may pass on some of the costs to consumers. That raises the specter of creeping inflation.
""This clearly will [lead to] higher prices in the production chain, which is part of the inflation path,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
The timing of the tariff news surprised Wall Street. A formal announcement was expected at some point Thursday, but then it was called off. Later, Trump mentioned his tariff plans in a hastily arranged listening session with steel and aluminum executives. And he didn't provide crucial details, such as whether certain countries will be exempted.
Concerns about trade come at an already shaky time on Wall Street. The S&P 500 and Dow fell about 4% in February, their worst month in two years. Fears about inflation and soaring bond yields caused a surge in volatility, including two 1,000-point plunges for the Dow.
The market had come back as investors focused on the strong economy and booming corporate profits. But stocks fell sharply again on Tuesday and Wednesday, putting the Dow back in negative territory for the year.
Turbulence has picked up as well. The VIX (VIX) volatility index spiked 15% on Thursday. Selling pressure will climb as volatility increases, Krosby said.
At least two corners of the stock market cheered Trump's tariff announcement. U.S. Steel (X) and AK Steel (AKS)soared 6% and 10%, respectively.
Century Aluminum (CENX) also spiked 7%. Another major aluminum maker, Alcoa (AA), gained 1%.
Trump's tariff moves could force investors to confront another trade issue: NAFTA. Trump has repeatedly threatened to tear up this major trade deal with Canada and Mexico. Talks to renegotiate NAFTA, a major piece of the U.S. economy, have so far failed to produce a solution.

71504,CNN,Wall Street is asking: Which Trump will we get?,"1. Trump vs. Trump: It's been 16 months since the election, but Wall Street is still trying to figure out which President Trump it will get.
Will it be pro-business Trump? His big corporate tax cuts and deregulation agenda fueled the stock market boom.
Or populist Trump? He demonized Goldman Sachs (GS) and hedge funds on the campaign trail and attacked American icons like Ford (F) on Twitter.
More recently, there's been protectionist Trump, whose love of tariffs and tirades against trade deals have raised the specter of an unwinnable trade war.
The pro-business crowd has been sounding the alarm about Trump the trade hawk since the White House proposed steep tariffs on aluminum and steel imports. They are set to go into effect in two weeks.
The Business Roundtable, a powerful business lobby, called the tariffs a ""major unforced error"" by Trump that will put ""tens of thousands of American jobs at risk.""
The Wall Street Journal's editorial page went a step further, saying Trump's ""protectionist eruption"" is a ""dangerous moment"" for his presidency. The risk, the paper said, is that he ""veers into the Herbert Hoover ditch.""
Related: Tariffs, Trump and trade war: What it all means
Wall Street seems to be betting that pro-business Trump will win, or at least that his tax cuts will provide a cushion against trade turbulence.
That bet may be based in part on Trump's own obsession with the performance of the stock market. Surely he wouldn't do anything to risk that, right?
Stocks climbed on Thursday after Trump softened his tariff stance by offering indefinite exemptions for Mexico and Canada. Trade fears were firmly in the rearview mirror by Friday as the Dow surged after a ""Goldilocks"" jobs report revealed strong employment gains coupled with modest wage increases.
But the risk of trade trouble is hardly over. Much will depend on how trading partners, especially the European Union, respond if they don't get exemptions of their own.
S&P Global Ratings warned in a report on Friday that Trump's tariffs raise the risk of a ""retaliatory spiral."" While a ""full-scale trade war"" isn't expected, the report said, ""such an outcome is not assured.""
And don't forget: Trump has signaled a bigger trade crackdown more squarely aimed at China is coming.
Chris Krueger of Cowen Washington Research Group lamented in a recent report that ""predicting what is going to happen on trade policy is impossible.""
The path for a more muscular trade agenda has been cleared by the resignation of Gary Cohn, Trump's top economic adviser and a staunch defender of free trade.
Cohn's eventual replacement could offer clues to Trump's next steps. Will he tap a defender of free trade like Larry Kudlow or even a Cohn-like deputy and Wall Street veteran, such as Shahira Knight?
Or will he go the other way and select a trade hawk like Peter Navarro?
If it's Navarro, Wall Street may be forced to prepare for protectionist Trump.
2. Inflation watch: On Tuesday, the Labor Department plans to release the Consumer Price Index for February. Wall Street will pay close attention to the inflation indicator.
In January, inflation rose faster than economists expected. That's bad news for investors, who fear that inflation could prompt the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly — and steeply — than it had planned. The Dow dipped slightly in early morning trading when the inflation figure was reported last month.
The market also reacted wildly following January's jobs report, which revealed that wages grew at the fastest pace in eight years.
Inflation fears have receded in recent weeks, especially after the February jobs report showed strong employment gains but a slowdown in wage growth. The Dow surged 441 points on the news.

Taken together, the two will shed light on how American consumers are feeling.
In January, US retail and food services sales ticked down 0.3% from December, but were 3.6% higher than in January 2017. And Michigan's index showed that Americans were out shopping in February: consumer sentiment was at its second highest level since 2004.

Signet, which owns mall-based Kay, Jared and Zales, reported weak sales last quarter and over the holidays. Mall closures are hurting the affordable jewelery brands, and will likely continue to pose a threat.

66447,ABC News,Texas mother of 5 whose murder conviction was overturned to receive $500K from the state,"Hannah Overton, a south Texas mother of five whose wrongful conviction for the 2006 death of her foster son was overturned last year, is expected to receive over $500,000 in compensation from the state for the years she spent in jail.
“I’m very thankful that this compensation is finally coming through,” Overton told ABC News. “No amount of money will ever bring back the years that were taken away, and the seven years of freedom I lost. I could never thank my attorneys enough for fighting endlessly to prove my innocence and bring me home.”
According to Overton’s attorney, Cynthia Orr, the Texas comptroller told Overton on Tuesday that she would receive a check for $573,333.33 as compensation her for her wrongful incarceration. She is also qualified to receive insurance and education benefits. Beginning next year, she will also receive an annuity.
“I am over the moon that Hannah has been granted compensation by Texas for her wrongful imprisonment,” Orr told ABC News. “She and her family do so much good with nothing. This small benefit will allow her and her sweet family to continue to share their goodness with all of us with some degree of comfort. It is a small thing for one who has suffered so greatly.""
Hannah Overton, who has long maintained her innocence, spent seven years in prison for the young child’s death. The salt poisoning case earned international attention because many believed she was wrongfully convicted and her story was featured in the 2017 documentary, “Until Proven Innocent.” ABC News has followed Overton's and her husband's story since her original 2007 trial.
Keith Hissong
In May 2017, Nueces County District Attorney Mark Gonzalez officially declared Overton innocent in the death of 4-year-old Andrew Burd, the child Overton and her husband, Larry Overton, were in the process of adopting before he died more than 10 years ago. That official statement granted her access to state funds that are provided to the wrongfully convicted and also prevented her from being tried for the crime again.
Overton was convicted of capital murder after being accused of force-feeding Burd enough sodium to kill him. The prosecution portrayed her as a mother who had lost control and tried to punish the young boy by giving him seasoning mixed in water. At the time, Overton had four children and was pregnant with a fifth, and had no prior trouble with the law.
Todd Yates/Corpus Christi Caller-Times/AP
The defense presented the jury with a medical mystery. They speculated Andrew might have had pica, an eating disorder characterized by an obsessive appetite and that Andrew accidentally poisoned himself by consuming a fatal amount of sodium.
Larry Overton was also charged with murder, but after his wife's conviction, he was offered a plea deal and was given probation. After he completed his probation, the charges were dismissed.
Overton was released on bond in December 2014 after a Texas appellate court overturned her conviction and life sentence. But former Nueces County District Attorney Mark Skurka charged Overton a second time for murder after her release.
Keith Hissong
Those charges were not considered double jeopardy because Overton’s conviction was overturned by the higher court on the basis of ineffective counsel, which granted her a new trial. Overton's original trial attorneys admitted at an appeals hearing that they had made errors.
Skurka ended up dropping the new case against her in 2015 but Overton remained in legal limbo until Gonzalez officially declared her innocence last year, thus closing a significant chapter on this decade-long case.
""After further review of all the evidence and meeting with her defense attorneys and everyone involved, my office decided that we're going to dismiss the case and include language in there that would actually indicate that she's not guilty of the charge that we charged her with, or the previous administration,"" Gonzalez said at the time.
Keith Hissong
The Overtons live in East Texas and told ABC News they have housed and supported prisoners after their release through their non-profit organization, Syndeo Ministries.
“I also could never begin to thank those who supported us, prayed and prayed for us, and walked with us along the entire way,” Overton said.

14163,The New York Times,He Studied Accounting. Now He Hunts the Taliban.,"Photo
AL UDEID AIR BASE, Qatar — When Navy Lt. William Conway is piecing together clues about a new Taliban or Islamic State terrorist cell in Afghanistan, he often falls back on skills he learned hauling crooks, swindlers and embezzlers into court in Chicago.
Lieutenant Conway is not your typical military intelligence analyst. A former state prosecutor in Chicago, he comes armed for his sleuthing duties with a law degree from Georgetown University and an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago. Not to mention an undergraduate degree in accounting from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.
All of which made Lieutenant Conway the right person at the right time, despite his relatively junior rank. He arrived at this air command center in August on Navy reservist duty to lead an Afghanistan intelligence team just as the Trump administration was ramping up its air and ground campaigns there.
“Working complicated embezzlement cases, it took a lot of time trying to trace individual transactions, how crimes had occurred or how a person was able to steal so much,” Lieutenant Conway said in an interview. “I use the same skills here, getting little nuggets of intelligence all the time — some important, some not — then weaving them together into a narrative.”

WASHINGTON — American consumers are the most confident they've been since 2000.
The Conference Board says its consumer confidence index rose to 130.8 in February, highest since November 2000 and up from 124.3 in January.
The business research group's index measures consumers' assessment of current conditions and their outlook for the next six months. They feel better about today's economy than they have since March 2001. Their outlook also improved.
Tax cuts passed into law last year are starting to show up in workers' paychecks. ""As people slowly absorb the details of the tax reform package, opinion polls suggest that it is becoming significantly more popular,"" Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, wrote in a research note.
A strong job market is boosting confidence. The unemployment rate has stayed at a 17-year low 4.1%.
Consumers shrugged off volatility in the stock market.
""Overall, consumers remain quite confident that the economy will continue expanding at a strong pace in the months ahead,"" says Lynn Franco, the Conference Board's director of economic indicators.
Economists watch the Conference Board report closely because consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic output.
The overall index hit bottom at 25.3 in February 2009 at the depths of the Great Recession before rebounding as the U.S. economy recovered.

47100,The New York Times,Why Does Trump Ignore Top Officials’ Warnings on Russia?,"Photo
The phalanx of intelligence chiefs who testified on Capitol Hill delivered a chilling message: Not only did Russia interfere in the 2016 election, it is already meddling in the 2018 election by using a digital strategy to exacerbate the country’s political and social divisions.
No one knows more about the threats to the United States than these six officials, so when they all agree, it would be derelict to ignore their concerns. Yet President Trump continues to refuse to even acknowledge the malevolent Russian role.
It’s particularly striking that four of the men who gave this warning to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday — the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo; the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats; the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray; and the Defense Intelligence Agency director, Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley — were all appointed by Mr. Trump.
They testified that the president has never asked them to take measures to combat Russian interference and protect democratic processes.

Mr. Trump isn’t completely oblivious about Russia, of course. He fired Mr. Wray’s predecessor, James Comey, to derail the F.B.I.’s investigation of possible Trump campaign involvement with the election hacking, and reportedly asked Mr. Coats and Mr. Pompeo to help end the investigation of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and Mr. Flynn’s contacts with Russians.

On a voice vote Tuesday, the Committee on House Administration passed a security resolution amending the Members' Congressional Handbook — read employee handbook — to make bulletproof vests a ""reimbursable expense.""
Under the changes to the handbook, members can hire security personnel for their district events, such as town halls, or to accompany them as they go about their official business. They also can pay for security guards to stand outside their district offices during business hours.

As for security improvements to members' home offices, such as building doorways or installing bulletproof glass, those are not reimbursable, but can be built into the monthly rent of the district office lease.
The move comes eight months after House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., was shot and nearly killed at an Alexandria, Va., ballpark, while practicing for the Congressional Baseball Game last June. Three others were wounded in the attack, including two members of Scalise's Capitol Police security detail.

125670,Slate,Did Diamond and Silk actually lie under oath? It's complicated.,"FEC records appear to show that the campaign paid the two pundits, but they claim otherwise. Rick Wilking/Reuters
Pro-Trump pundits Diamond and Silk faced questions about their relationship to the Trump campaign at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday, and their answers led to suggestions they had lied under oath.
The duo may not have been forthcoming in their answers—and they may have yelled a lot— but there looks to be more nuance to the situation than it initially appeared.
The hearing, titled “Filtering Practices of Social Media Platforms,” was called to discuss accusations that Facebook and other social media platforms suppress conservative content. Diamond and Silk’s Facebook page had briefly been labeled “unsafe to the community,” which many Republicans took as proof of censorship despite the company saying it was simply a mistake. That made the duo a popular subject during Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony earlier this month and got them invited to testify on Thursday.
During the hearing, Texas congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee asked whether Diamond and Silk had ever received money from the Trump campaign.
Diamond, whose real name is Lynnette Hardaway, said five times under oath that she had not.
Later, New York Congressman Hakeem Jeffries pointed to FEC records that showed the campaign had paid them $1,274.94 for “field consulting.” He reminded them that they would be committing perjury if they lied under oath.
Silk, whose real name is Rochelle Richardson, responded, “We’re familiar with that particular lie. We could see that you do look at fake news.”
She then went on to claim that the payment was actually a reimbursement for plane tickets they purchased to fly to a Women for Trump event in Ohio and suggested that the campaign may have made a mistake in their FEC filings.
Trump campaign treasurer Bradley Crate sent Slate a statement that supported their version of events:
The issue regarding Diamond and Silk is merely one of semantics, resulting from a reasonable misunderstanding of the Campaign’s reporting obligations. The Campaign’s payment to Diamond and Silk for field consulting was based on an invoice they submitted reflecting their costs for air travel to a Campaign event. The invoice was not supported by accompanying receipts, so as a technical matter, could not be reported as a reimbursement even though its purpose was to make them whole for their out-of-pocket costs.
It’s unclear whether other parts of their testimony were accurate, such as their claims that YouTube had demonetized their videos or that Facebook had intentionally censored them for being conservative, but the discrepancy around payment could reasonably have been caused by the nuances of campaign finance laws.",LEFT

91718,CNN,"CNN Poll: On Russia, Americans' views are settled and partisan","WASHINGTON (CNN) American opinions on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election appears hardened and driven by partisanship, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS after a month rife with developments in the ongoing probe.
Overall, 6 in 10 say they see the investigation as a serious matter that should be fully investigated (58% say so), while around a third (36%) say it's mainly an effort to discredit Donald Trump's presidency. Those figures haven't changed significantly since February despite recent escalations in rhetoric from the President against the investigation and special counsel Robert Mueller specifically.
Since a February survey with similar findings, developments in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election include news that Mueller's team is investigating Trump's financial dealings in Russia, upheaval on Trump's personal legal team, a report produced by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee concluding that no collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia was found, a slew of tweets from the President directly criticizing the probe and Mueller himself and a statement from Trump's lawyer praying for the end of the investigation.
But neither views of Trump's handling of the probe nor those of Mueller's work have budged since February. The President continues to receive lower approval ratings for his handling of the Russia investigation than does Mueller (32% approve of Trump, 48% Mueller) -- both ratings are largely unchanged in the last month.

The race could be one of the most expensive and highly watched in all the midterm elections.
Florida school shooting survivors release 'cathartic' memorial magazine Read more
Scott is leaving office due to term limits. He has been urged to challenge Nelson, Florida’s only statewide-elected Democrat, by Donald Trump. Earlier this year, Scott’s closeness to the president yielded for his state an exemption from plans to expand offshore drilling.
In formally announcing his campaign on Monday, Scott was expected to criticize “career politicians” and call for term limits for members of Congress.
“I admit that Washington is horribly dysfunctional,” Scott said, according to scripted remarks made available ahead of the announcement in Orlando.
“Washington is full of old thinking. Washington is tired. And the truth is, both political parties share some of the blame. They’ve tried a lot of things – it just didn’t work. But I will not accept the idea that we can’t change Washington.”
Scott is a multimillionaire who had not run for office before he won a gubernatorial election in 2010. He campaigned as part of the Tea Party movement and called for massive budget and tax cuts – and was then forced to scale back his plans amid opposition from the Republican-controlled state legislature. He also changed his hardline positions on immigration.
Democrats have been anticipating Scott’s move and have ramped up criticism, noting that he was forced out as chief executive of Columbia/HCA amid a federal fraud investigation. Although Scott was never charged with any wrongdoing, the healthcare conglomerate paid a then record $1.7bn fine for Medicare fraud.
Democrats also plan to fault Scott over his record while governor, including his push for deep budget cuts to education and his back-and-forth position on whether to expand Medicaid.
“Floridians will have the benefit of a clear-eyed view of a truly dismal record,” said Dan Gelber, a former state senator who is now mayor of Miami Beach. “Floridians won’t forget the damage Rick Scott’s self-serving politics have done these last seven years, no matter how he tries to change his spots and obscure his record.”
Before the killings of 17 people at a Florida high school in February, Scott had an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association. He then signed a new law raising the age limit to purchase rifles to 21 and creating a process enabling law-enforcement officers to seize guns from someone who is considered a danger.
Scott has contended that Nelson has “done nothing” on high-profile issues such as gun violence. Nelson has said Scott has not done enough – he wants universal background checks and a ban on certain types of semi-automatic rifles.
Most polls predict a Scott-Nelson race to be close, although according to the realclearpolitics.com average, Nelson holds a lead in most.",LEFT

70815,NPR,Shots - Health News,"Medical Cargo Could Be The Gateway For Routine Drone Deliveries
Enlarge this image toggle caption Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Johns Hopkins School of Medicine
One shred of solace that surfaced as hurricanes and tropical storms pummeled Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico last fall was the opportunity to see drones realize some of their life-saving potential.
During those disasters unmanned aircraft surveyed wrecked roads, bridges and rail lines. They spotted oil and gas leaks. They inspected damaged cell towers that had left thousands unable to call for help. ""Drones became a literal lifeline,"" former Federal Aviation Administration chief Michael Huerta told the agency's drone advisory committee in November.
The drones used needed a special exemption from a set of FAA rules, known as Part 107, that normally require small drones to fly below 400 feet, stay within the operator's visual line of sight and avoid populated areas.
These regulations make it hard for commercial drones to operate in the United States. But last October the Department of Transportation took a big step: It invited state and local governments to partner with universities and companies on tests to speed the integration of drones into the national airspace. The FAA is reviewing 149 proposals and plans to choose five to 10 by mid-May.
The proposals cover a wide range of applications. Many of them are health-related. ""I am confident that one-half or more of all the applicants have put some element of medical support in their proposal,"" says John Walker, a Lancaster, Penn.-based aerospace consultant who spent 32 years at the FAA before co-founding the Padina Group, Inc in 2006.
Walker believes early public acceptance of drone delivery networks in urban areas will revolve around hospitals. And once drones can safely and reliably carry blood and medical supplies, that will pave the way to other kinds of drone deliveries. ""That linear network where drones can operate between hospitals ... would also have Amazon and anyone else that could meet the requirements to operate,"" Walker says.
Several companies have approached governments in developing countries about performing medical deliveries in areas with great need, poor roads and less crowded skies.
In late 2016 Zipline, a San Francisco Bay Area-based robotics startup, set up distribution centers in Rwanda, where its drones had made more than 1400 flights carrying on-demand blood and emergency supplies over 62,000 miles as of last fall. This year the company will expand its medical delivery operations by launching a second base in Rwanda and new service in a larger neighboring country, Tanzania.
Last October Swiss Post launched a medical transport network in Lugano, Switzerland, using drones made by another Bay Area company, Matternet. So far the drones have made 350 deliveries, about 5 to 15 per day. Other groups have also brought aircraft abroad to attempt health-related deliveries, but those demo flights have not become sustained operations.
Such efforts face tougher hurdles here in the U.S. where regulations focus on safely integrating drones into already congested national airspace. ""We haven't seen [the FAA] be interested in a one-off approach,"" says Susan Roberts, co-founder of AiRXOS, a General Electric subsidiary focused on drone infrastructure technologies. ""It doesn't do anybody any good for a delivery company to be able to fly from two specific points if they can't then scale that over and over again.""
Beyond blood and medical supply deliveries, drones could transform another key component of healthcare — lab tests. Timely test results help doctors diagnose infections and reduce guesswork in prescribing medications. Some of those decisions have life-or-death implications. For example, newborn babies turn yellow from jaundice as their bodies make bilirubin, a byproduct formed during normal breakdown of red blood cells. But ""very high bilirubin can be toxic to babies,"" says Dr. Geoff Baird, a clinical pathologist at the University of Washington in Seattle.
Of the millions of blood samples, urine specimens and swabs his team processes each year, most reach central lab facilities by car. ""We have cars going seven days a week, many times a day, up and down the state of Washington on freeways, across the passes, in the mountains,"" Baird says. The university also does testing for out-of-state hospitals and several clinics in rural communities on the San Juan Islands off the northwest coast of Washington. Getting lab samples from the islands down to Seattle hospitals for testing requires multiple stops by car, plane and ferry — a journey of about 100 miles that often takes more than 24 hours, even longer on weekends.
But samples carried over the Puget Sound on a drone from the San Juan Islands could reach the main lab in Seattle in 90 minutes, Baird says. That's why the university was eager to put in a bid for the FAA program.

The proposed medical deliveries are part of a larger application submitted by Washington's Department of Transportation, which includes other companies such as Amazon and T-Mobile. If selected, Baird says the San Juan efforts will use drones developed at Tuscon, Ariz.-based Latitude Engineering. Latitude makes the military-grade aircraft that Johns Hopkins researchers used to set a distance record carrying refrigerated blood samples ~160 miles in a 3-hour flight across the desert.
North Carolina's Department of Transportation also applied to the FAA program wanting to use drones for medical deliveries. Zipline and Matternet are on that application as well as several other undisclosed proposals. Matternet is also partnering with the city of Palo Alto on a proposal to shuttle blood to Stanford hospitals. Flirtey, a drone manufacturer in Reno, Nev., is focusing on using its aircraft for last-mile delivery of defibrillators — devices the company thinks could save hundreds of thousands of lives in America each year, by increasing the chance of survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
Ultimately, though, what makes or breaks a proposal isn't likely the whiz-bang drones but rather the underlying infrastructure that ensures they can fly safely alongside commercial jets, helicopters, balloons and everything else in the sky.
Toward that end, at a drone symposium held earlier this week in Baltimore, the FAA stressed its interest in ""sense and avoid"" technologies to prevent drone crashes, and systems that allow drones to be identified and tracked remotely. GE's projects cover both areas. ""No one company is going to solve everything. We're taking a holistic approach,"" Roberts says. ""We need to help the medical deliveries, we need to help the inspectors, we need to help people who are just taking pictures of houses.""
The United Nations Children's Fund is working to foster this all-inclusive spirit at the global level. Last summer, UNICEF worked with local governments in the African country of Malawi to launch a drone corridor for companies, universities and nonprofits to fly test missions there.
More recently, UNICEF invited groups to transport vaccines in Vanuatu, the South Pacific nation made up of roughly 80 islands east of Australia. The drone corridors run on a barter system, says Chris Fabian, who leads UNICEF's venture capital arm. ""If you come and use our time, create something that's open-source and useful for everyone else.""

5515,The New York Times,Iran’s Protesters Want One Thing: Accountability,"Maybe these things all add up on the same ledger; maybe they don’t. But many Iranians understand that their country has resources their families never see.
Taking to the streets is a high-risk activity in Iran. So it is all the more notable that for the first time people are demonstrating without any purchase on the country’s political establishment. On the contrary: Even reformist politicians have chastised these protesters and suggested they are serving foreign masters.

The protesters, in turn, do not spare any political faction their ire. By contrast, in 1999 and 2009 popular protests were largely orchestrated through the reformist faction, an affiliation that provided the demonstrators with leadership, a civil rights agenda that didn’t overflow the bounds of the Constitution, and tactical limits that protesters could breach only at their risk.
This current round of protests, by all accounts, are bound by none of these constraints. They reportedly began as a hard-line assault on Mr. Rouhani but quickly acquired an independent momentum and spontaneously spread. There are no leaders to imprison or publicly humiliate, no democratic agenda to tar by association with Western values and no reason for protesters to avoid disruptive tactics or slogans that antagonize the entire ruling system. These demonstrations don’t pit elites against one another but citizens against the state. Some of the people I know who were active in the 2009 uprising profess to be frightened today — of chaos and the potential for destructive demagogy. Others call for unity in opposition.
If there is one thing Americans should know by now about Iran, it is how little we know it. The Iranian regime, with its heavy-handed censorship and self-isolation, has made sure of this. So has the pitched battle over American foreign policy on Iran, which renders Iran’s domestic realities as talking points in a conversation that is really about us. There is an almost embarrassing cone of silence around today’s protesters. They live in provincial cities, Tehran reformists don’t speak for them and they are not the sorts of people connected with the domestic or international news media. Moreover, their likely demographic has been subject to casual generalizations that turn out to be wrong.
For instance, the conventional wisdom inside and outside Iran has long held that the lower and working classes in Iran were clients of the state and the core hard-line constituency. Kevan Harris, a sociologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, conducted a study of welfare recipients and political affiliation that called this assumption into question. It turns out that loyalty is not so easily bought. Welfare recipients are not more politically predictable than other Iranians. And now it seems that when members of this cohort turn up on Iran’s streets, after years of being told that there is nothing wrong with an economy that can’t keep factory doors open or food on the table, their slogans are more radical than those of the presumptive middle class.
Ayatollah Khamenei, for his part, has spent these days of rage composing anti-American tweets, warning of an American plot to dismember the country and comparing President Trump unfavorably with Ronald Reagan. This is both deflection and political savvy. Nationalism is a powerful current in Iranian life, and Mr. Trump is offering Ayatollah Khamenei the gift of a credible straw man — with alacrity, it seems. But American sound and fury mainly serve to obfuscate a domestic quandary.

Every decade or so in Iran, protests erupt whose scale, intensity and persistence make global headlines. The ideological punditry flows. We read that the regime is universally hated and about to fall, and then we read that the regime is strong and the oppositionists are marginal people of no account — because, in 2009, they were predominantly middle class, or because, in 2018, they are not. Security forces crack down, the regime doesn’t fall, and dissent remains stalwart and pervasive.
A political scientist once told me that Iran is the exception that proves the rule: It’s the textbook example of the country that meets every precondition for democratic transition but still refuses to change.
Iranian protests repeatedly come down to one thing: the accountability of the regime to its people. But Ayatollah Khamenei has buttered his bread on the other side. His power depends on the continued stranglehold of the security state, which he has also made the country’s economic center of gravity. So long as this is true, he can’t or won’t address the root cause of Iran’s chronic unrest.",LEFT

Grewal, who is also a resident of Glen Rock, congratulated the Glen Rock Police Department on their 100th Anniversary. (Photo: Carole Rafferty/Special to northjersey.com)
Democratic attorneys general from 20 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday demanded that federal officials end the practice of separating adults caught crossing the border from their children, saying the policy is undermining community trust and hurting law enforcement efforts.
The letter was sent to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, and it opposed the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” to immigration enforcement.
Because the new policy requires that all unlawful immigrants be held in criminal custody, any children in their care are taken from them and sent to shelters.
""What’s happening on the border is having a direct impact on what’s happening in New Jersey,” New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said in a statement. “As a career prosecutor, I’ve seen that law enforcement works best when it has the trust of local communities, and the heartlessness of the Administration’s family separation policy is undermining the trust we’ve worked so hard to build. That makes it less likely crime victims and witnesses will come forward to work with law enforcement and that, in turn, makes our communities less safe.”
The practice of separating children from their migrant parents has sparked a backlash among both Democrats and Republicans, but the Trump administration on Monday defended the policy, saying that some who have been stopped at the border are not entering with their own children.
Nielsen, fielding questions during the daily White House briefing on Monday, said it was up to Congress to fix the immigration system, and that the administration was just enforcing existing law.

2018 picked up where 2017 left off with eye-popping palace intrigue mixed with the widening net of the Department of Justice's Russia investigation.
The week kicked off with tabloid-like, tell-all details from the new book Fire and Fury with explosive on-the-record and blind quotes from White House insiders. It led to the president eviscerating his former chief strategist Steve Bannon, accusing him of losing his mind and branding him as ""Sloppy Steve.""
Some details in Wolff's book, which among other things questions the president's competence and mental stability, have not just been questioned by the White House, but also by reporters. Wolff, though, says he has hours of audio recordings and defended the top-selling book in an interview with NPR's All Things Considered Friday.
""When you write a book like this, people regret what they said to me,"" Wolff contended. ""What they say to any reporter who they relax with and they forget who they're talking to. I have sympathy for that, and I think the natural response is to say, 'Oh my god, I didn't say it.' But I will tell you, they said it.""
The week ended with a bombshell report from The New York Times about how Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe may be targeting the president for obstruction of justice over his attempts to stop the attorney general from recusing himself from the investigation. The Times reported Trump dispatched White House counsel Don McGahn to stop Sessions from going through with it. It didn't work, and Trump was furious. The president believed, according to the Times, that the attorney general's job was to protect the president.
For his part, Trump sees it all as politically motivated, tweeting Friday:
It was a remarkable week and start to the new year that could portend a politically consequential 2018.

The House intelligence committee will on Tuesday question Steve Bannon, the one-time confidant to Donald Trump who has fallen spectacularly from power.
'It's all explosive': Michael Wolff on Donald Trump Read more
The House panel is speeding toward a conclusion of its interviews in its investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and alleged collusion between Trump aides and Moscow.
Bannon lost the backing of key Republican donors and his position at the hard-right Breitbart News after the publication – first reported by the Guardian – of an explosive book on the Trump White House by the journalist Michael Wolff.
The former White House strategist and Trump campaign manager was a key source for the book, in which he was quoted as calling a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York City between Trump aides including Donald Trump Jr and presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner “treasonous”, “unpatriotic” and “bad shit”.
The Trump aides believed the Russians at the meeting had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate for president.
“The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor – with no lawyers,” Bannon is quoted as saying in Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.
“They didn’t have any lawyers. Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it’s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately.”
Bannon also gave a prescription for how such a meeting should have been set up and said he believed the Russians would likely have been introduced to Donald Trump.
“The chance that Don Jr did not walk these jumos up to his father’s office on the 26th floor is zero,” he said.
Bannon also predicted to Wolff that special counsel Robert Mueller would focus his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election on money-laundering.
The Trump White House was “sitting on a beach trying to stop a category five” hurricane, he said, adding that Mueller’s investigators would “crack Don Jr like an egg on national TV”.
In the ensuing explosion of controversy, in which Wolff’s portrayal of White House aides’ doubts about Trump’s capacity for the job loomed large, Trump disavowed “Sloppy Steve” and argued there was no evidence of collusion between his presidential campaign and operatives tied to Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Bannon rowed back, saying his remarks about the “treasonous” meeting had only referred to Paul Manafort, his predecessor in charge of the Trump campaign who is one of four aides indicted by Mueller. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to money-laundering charges.
Bannon, who also told Wolff he knows no Russians, would not be a witness in any investigations, would not hire a lawyer and would not appear on national television answering questions, recently retained the same lawyer being used by former Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House general counsel Don McGahn.
Bannon is scheduled to testify before the House panel on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the committee’s plans not authorized to discuss private committee deliberations and speaking to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
Neither Bannon nor his lawyer responded to requests by the AP for comment.
How Bannon turned on Trump … and where the nationalist right goes next Read more
Russian election meddling is being investigated by Mueller, who was appointed by the justice department after Trump fired FBI director James Comey, and panels from both houses of Congress.
Bannon, who left the White House in August 2017, has so far avoided the scrutiny of congressional investigators, who have instead focused on trying to secure interviews with top witnesses like Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.
But Bannon played a critical role in the campaign, the presidential transition and the White House – all now under scrutiny from congressional investigators looking for evidence of a connection between Trump’s operations and Russia.
The final result of the House investigation could be marred by partisan infighting. Some committee members have discussed the probability that Republicans on the panel will issue one set of findings and the Democrats will issue their own report.",LEFT

The appointment of a £1,150-a-day interim chief executive at a cash-strapped council ""lacked transparency"", a union has claimed.
Damon Lawrenson was given the role at Northamptonshire County Council ""too quickly"", Unison said.
The Conservative-run authority banned nearly all spending and has been labelled England's ""worst-run council"".
The council said the position was not advertised but the appointment ensured a ""quick and efficient transition"".
Northamptonshire branch secretary for Unison, Penny Smith, has now criticised the recruitment process, saying it was not ""open or transparent"".
She said she remained ""confused"" about why Mr Lawrenson was put in charge in October.
He had previously been the council's finance director and Ms Smith said the process happened ""too quickly"".
""He must be in some way culpable for the mess we are in,"" she said.
The council has blamed ""historically-low reserves, heavy reductions in government funding alongside soaring demand and costs in social care"" for its financial position.
Northamptonshire County Council's financial crisis: A timeline
Chris Stanbra, leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition, said Mr Lawrenson was appointed to the role ""because of the haste"" with which Dr Blantern left.
""It is ironic Mr Lawrenson is a highly-paid consultant when officers are telling councillors expenditure on consultants is being actively and deliberately reduced,"" he said.
Mr Lawrenson was the council's interim group director of finance from July 2016 to October last year.
A Local Government Association report criticised the authority for having ""very optimistic"" financial plans when he was in the post.

Damon Lawrenson's contract as interim chief executive
Mr Lawrenson is employed until June through his company, DDL Consultancy
He is paid for days he works and not eligible for sick pay, holiday pay or pension contributions
He has worked an average of four days per week, meaning he will receive about £230,000 per year
The council estimates his pay will not be ""significantly different"" from the amount Dr Blantern would have received, including on-costs such as pension contributions
No extra money is paid to Mr Lawrenson's company
Source: Northamptonshire County Council
Mr Lawrenson was first employed at the council between June 2008 and February 2011 as assistant chief executive finance and assistant chief executive.
During that time, the authority took out four of 19 bank loans, known as Lender Option Borrower Option (LOBO) loans, described by financial experts as ""toxic"".
Another, taken out in 2010, comes with an interest rate of more than 11%.
The authority said the LOBO loans were commonly used by councils and were not considered ""toxic"" at the time. It added they were deemed appropriate and endorsed by full council.
Image copyright LinkedIn Image caption Damon Lawrenson lists successfully navigating Northamptonshire County Council through KPMG's advisory note as one of his achievements
In 2011, after leaving the authority following his first stint, Mr Lawrenson wrote in The Guardian that he had ""transformed"" its financial position and left behind ""a legacy of financial stability"".
On his LinkedIn page, he references ""successfully navigating"" a note from auditors KPMG, saying the authority was in danger of passing an unlawful budget, and ""implementing improvements"" following the LGA peer review report.
The council spokesman said: ""Damon's appointment was interim to ensure a quick and efficient transition from the previous chief executive in advance of a permanent appointment. Damon was already an interim and so continued with the engagement.
""His engagement as finance director was coming to an end after a permanent appointment was made for December 2017.
""Although the interim role was not advertised internally or externally, discussions did take place with cabinet members, senior directors and local government colleagues.""",UNDEFINED

President Donald Trump was angry Sunday morning following a long, deeply reported piece in the Washington Post that claimed Chief of Staff John Kelly no longer has the power he once did inside the White House. The Post “is far more fiction than fact,” the president wrote. “Story after story is made up garbage—more like a poorly written novel than good reporting.” Trump then added flatly that the paper’s story on Kelly “isn’t true” and amounts to “just another hit job!”
The Washington Post is far more fiction than fact. Story after story is made up garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting. Always quoting sources (not names), many of which don’t exist. Story on John Kelly isn’t true, just another hit job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2018
This marks only the president’s latest attack against the paper, and its owner, Jeff Bezos. But the president is going to have to attack more than the Post to dismiss the story about a chief of staff in peril, considering it has become something of a theme. The clashes between Kelly and the president are “recurring and escalating,” wrote the Post. “Both his credibility and his influence have been severely diminished.”
Although Kelly was once seen as the man who could bring order to the White House, he is increasingly being left out of key decisions. And he no longer has the trust and support of some of the key members of Trump’s staff. The Post even notes he once angered First Lady Melania Trump. This is all par for the course when it comes to Trump’s White House. The Post explains:
Kelly is the latest high-profile example of a West Wing Icarus — swept high into Trump’s orbit, only to be singed and cast low. Nearly everyone who has entered the White House has emerged battered — rendered a punchline (former press secretary Sean Spicer), a Justice Department target (former national security adviser Michael Flynn) or a diminished shell, fired by presidential tweet (former secretary of state Rex Tillerson). No one knows how many days remain for Kelly, but when he leaves — either by the president’s hand or because of his own mounting frustration — he is almost certain to limp away damaged.
The Post is hardly alone in its assessment. Shortly before the paper published its story, Axios reported that Kelly threatened to quit on March 28 after a loud argument in an Oval Office meeting. “Very few people inside this White House feel secure or satisfied, given the wild, unpredictable mood and policy changes of Trump,” noted Axios’ Jonathan Swan. “Kelly months ago restored some order and sanity to the place but most of that is gone.”

Ina Rogers, 30, and husband Jonathan Allen, 29, were arraigned on an amended complaint before a Superior Court judge in a case involving allegations that the children were waterboarded, bitten and burned with scalding water.
The new complaint charges Allen with 20 felony counts, including seven alleging torture, nine for abuse or endangerment and four for allegedly committing a lewd and lascivious act on a child under 14.
Rogers faces nine felony counts of abuse or endangerment and one misdemeanor count of child endangering by health, according to the complaint.
The children have told investigators they had suffered puncture wounds, burns and bruising, as well as injuries consistent with being shot by pellet guns or BB guns.

186565,The Guardian,Gosport hospital deaths: families condemn 'scandalous' failings,"Families of the Gosport War Memorial hospital victims launched an excoriating attack on a system that held 12 separate investigations into the deaths yet held no one accountable.
Gosport hospital: more than 450 patients died due to opioid drugs policy Read more
“The inexcusable failure of them all is not only shameful, it is scandalous and it is immoral,” they said in a statement, read by Bridget Reeves, whose 88-year-old grandmother, Elsie Devine, died at the hospital in 1999.
Their “vulnerable” relatives “were stripped of their final words to their loved ones, silenced by overdoses”. It was “more than catastrophic”, they said.
“As victims of crime, we are all entitled to have an explanation when an alleged injustice has occurred. But this has been sinister, calculating, and those implicated must now face the full rigour of the criminal justice system.”
“These horrifying, shameful, unforgivable actions need to be disclosed in a criminal court for a jury to decide. Only then can we put our loved ones to rest.”
They described the lockdown, for 11 years, of the release of findings of a 2002 inquiry, as “an abuse by powers of the almighty”. They added: “The Department of Health and its chief medical officer ignored those serious findings and continued to put patient safety at the bottom of the pile.”
They described as “at best incompetent” a Hampshire police investigation, triggered by a “whistleblower” providing 1991 documentation “highlighting a culture that Dr [Jane] Barton [the GP accuses of prescribing deadly doses of painkillers to patients] had bought to the hospital”. The CPS’s failure to secure convictions was “devastating”.
'Disregard for human life': Gosport hospital inquiry's key findings Read more
Even more criticism was heaped on the inquests held into the deaths of 10 of the victims, with Barton and the nursing team afforded “top barristers” while relatives “had to fight for our legal representation coming on board at the 11th hour”.
Documentation was “redacted or simply removed” to ensure jurors did not get the whole picture, the statement said. “And, whilst they [jury] did still manage to conclude that the drugs administered were inappropriate, without logic, unjustifiable and shortened life,” the relatives were angered that the jury concluded they were given for “therapeutic purposes”.
Of the “defective” GMC hearing, which did not strike Barton off the medical register, “that proved to us all that they are simply not fit for purpose”.
Relatives had been treated with contempt throughout, they said. “Every government body and or quango locked together, with no chance of objectivity, impartiality and, ultimately, the truth.” There had been “inequality of arms” to stop families achieving justice, and regulatory bodies appeared to “do whatever they want”.
Knowing that complaints had been made the police in 1998 would have caused “outrage” if it had been made public at the time. “None of us would have allowed out loved ones to be admitted to Gosport War Memorial hospital had we known there was an ongoing police investigation.”
Victims
Elsie Devine, 88, Reeve’s grandmother, like others, died after the inappropriate administration of opioids, whose prescription was not in the best interests of the patient. She had been admitted for rehabilitation with kidney problems. Like many others she was “opioid-naive”, ie not chronically receiving opioid analgesics on a daily basis. She was given diamorphine and midazolam two days before her death in 1999. “My seven-stone grandmother, who did not have dementia and was recovering from a kidney infection, was pinned to the floor by four nurses and given enough drugs to lay out a 6ft violent man,” Reeves recently told the Sunday Times.
Gladys Richards , 91, who had dementia and lived in a nursing home, was admitted for rehabilitation on 17 August 1998 after fracturing her hip. She died four days later. Her daughter, Gillian MacKenzie, now 84, was the first relative to raise the alarm. “When I had contacted the police and said I wanted an appointment with somebody over an allegation of unlawful killing, I was told: “There there, my dear. You’re upset,” she told the BBC. Fighting for justice had taken over her life.
Arthur Cunningham, known as Brian, 79, was a widower with Parkinson’s disease and dementia, but was admitted for treatment for a pressure sore in September 1998. The former wartime fighter pilot died five days later. “He went in to be treated for bedsores. There’s no way he was near death,” his stepson Charles Farthing, told the Sunday Times. He was also opioid naïve. He was given a three-fold increase in pain relief three days before his death., the report said. The inquiry stated the hospital notes recorded relatives were anxious about the treatment.
Robert Wilson, 74, who died in 1998 was meant to be receiving rehabilitation after fracturing a shoulder, and was another the inquiry panel assessed had been administered opioids without appropriate clinical indication. He had told his family he was being drugged to death. “Help me, they’re killing me,” he begged his son Iain Wilson.
“I said, “No they’re not, Dad. They’re trying to do the best for you,” Wilson told the Sunday Times. “When I went in the following day, he was in a coma.” He added: “How I wish now I’d trust my instincts and got him out.”
Stan Carby, 65, a former naval officer, died in 1999 within 24 hours of being admitted to rehabilitation following a series of mini-strokes. His daughter, Cindy Grant, said he was expected to be home in a couple of weeks and relatives had seen him at 10.30pm the night before, when he was in “good spirits”. The next morning he was in a coma. When they asked Barton if he was going to die, she said: “Well, you’ve got to just let nature takes its course,” Grant told Radio 4’s Today programme. “He wasn’t in there to die. He was in there to get better,” said Grant.
Peggy Coates, 76, transferred from another hospital for rehabilitation after a stroke on June 2 1999. She died on 15 July , on the day she was given the first and high dose of diamorphine, the report said. The plan had been for her to return home, it said, so it was not clear why, on her admission, Barton wrote in the hospital notes: “Please make comfortable.....I am happy for my staff to confirm death.”",LEFT
179226,The Guardian,Democratic 2020 hopefuls toe progressive line at liberal conference,"Potential Democratic presidential candidates set out their 2020 credentials on Tuesday for a gathering of liberal activists, with barely a hint of daylight between them on a range of key progressive issues.
Speaking to an energetic crowd of hundreds in a Washington hotel ballroom, the candidates took turns touting their liberal bona fides in both prepared remarks and in answers to questions from questioners who had been chosen in advance.
Five Democratic senators appeared at the We The People Summit, an event hosted by number of major progressive groups, including the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and Planned Parenthood, that rallied attendees on issues ranging from mass incarceration to Medicare for All.

Chris Shelton, the president of CWA, which was one of the few unions to back Bernie Sanders in 2016, set the tone in his opening remarks when he said: “Today we come together to send a clear message to the Democratic party: that it must embrace a clear people’s agenda.”
He was followed by one of the event’s moderators, Heather McGhee of the thinktank Demos, who said: “We’re not pulling the party left, we’re pulling it into the future.”
The impact of that pull was seen in the question-and-answer session when the New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand embraced a financial transactions tax, saying: “Income inequality is the greatest threat to democracy right now.” Cory Booker, who was attacked during the 2012 election for defending Bain Capital, the private equity firm that once employed Mitt Romney, criticized the company by name along with several other hedge funds for “toxic” practices. Bain acquired Toys R Us, a New Jersey-based company, in 2005 as part of a leveraged buyout. The toy retailer recently declared bankruptcy, leaving its 30,000 workers without severance.
But all of the potential presidential hopefuls shared an allegiance to a laundry list of progressive issues.
They argued for a strong social safety net and condemned the Trump administration in equal measure. Booker insisted “you cannot have life, liberty or pursuit of happiness without public education, without retirement security, equal justice under the law” while the California Senator Kamala Harris said government had three essential functions “public education, public safety and public health”.
The room did not lack for criticisms of Trump. Bernie Sanders proclaimed that right-to-work laws were an “obscenity” while deriding the president for his demographic desire to divide up the country.
Elizabeth Warren at one point echoed Trump’s rhetoric about “draining the swamp” when she called for “hosing out the cesspool of corruption” in Washington DC.

Perhaps the most vigorous applause in the room was for the outgoing congressman Luis Gutiérrez, who received standing ovations and loud cheers when he condemned the Trump administration’s immigration policy and its efforts to crack down on asylum seekers and separate migrant families at the US-Mexico border. “I can think of nothing more cruel, more evil than to rip a child from a mother’s arms who is fleeing systematic rape, murder, torture.”
The Illinois Democrat also received loud cheers when he insisted that Puerto Rico’s energy grid should be rebuilt with “no carbon footprint”.
Phyllis Salowe-Kaye, executive director of NJ Citizen Action, a progressive advocacy group, was pleased that the crop of potential 2020 Democratic candidates is farther to the left than at any time in recent memory. But she said there was still work to do.
“It’s a good bench,” she said. “But 2020 is years away and I think some of them still need to be more progressive.”
Laila El-Zayatie and Xavier Thomas, college students in Pennsylvania, said they were impressed by Gillibrand and Gutiérrez, neither of whom they had heard of before the conference.
“His speech was the best of the night,” said Thomas. “He spoke straight from the heart.”

And yet after the summit finished both of them, who were Sanders supporters in 2016, still had a soft spot for the Vermonter.
“I agreed with so much of what he stood for before he ran,” said El-Zayatie. “He really has dedicated his entire life to trying to actively help people.” She also found another reason to support Sanders. “We’re both Jewish. We need that representation,” said the student at Millersville University.
Stacey Nelson, an SEIU member from Newark, New Jersey, said the remarks by her home state senator Cory Booker brought tears to her eyes.
“I really liked his message that we need to treat people the same,” Nelson said, nodding emphatically when asked if she would like him to run for president.
She said being in the room of activists was uplifting despite what she said was a constant stream of setbacks for people of color and immigrants.
“It feels like we’re in a fight – a real fight,” she said.",LEFT

138890,ABC News,"Oil jumps, Asian shares mixed after US leaves Iran deal","Oil prices surged while Asian stock markets traded mixed on Wednesday after President Donald Trump announced the United States will withdraw from a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran and re-impose sanctions.
KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 0.4 percent to 22,408.88 and South Korea's Kospi retreated 0.2 percent to 2,443.98. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index added 0.1 percent to 30,445.07 while the Shanghai Composite Index dipped 0.1 percent to 3,159.15. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.3 percent to 6,108.00. Stocks rose in Taiwan, Singapore and Indonesia but fell in Thailand and the Philippines.
IRAN DEAL: The U.S. decision to leave the Iran nuclear deal, which required Iran to curb its nuclear enrichment program in exchange for relief from international sanctions, will be followed by a restoration of harsh sanctions aimed at limiting Iran's ability to sell oil or conduct other overseas business. Now Iran, the world's fifth-largest oil producer, will have to decide whether to follow the U.S. and withdraw or try to salvage what's left with the European countries. Should supply constraints push oil prices higher, Asia would see a mixed impact. Costs would rise for countries that rely heavily on imports, such as Japan, while exporters like Indonesia would see revenues rise.
ANALYST'S TAKE: ""Geopolitical risks are heightened especially if Iran retaliates, but it could wait and see if the deal is completely undone or if there is scope for it to continue without the U.S.,"" Mizuho Bank said in a daily commentary. With Germany, France and Britain saying they are committed to the accord, the European countries will ""continue importing oil from Iran, albeit having to side-step the U.S. banking system for trade purposes,"" it said.

96862,The New York Times,"Poisoned Door Handle Hints at High-Level Plot to Kill Spy, U.K. Officials Say","LONDON — British officials investigating the poisoning of Sergei V. Skripal, a former Russian double agent, believe it is likely that an assassin smeared a nerve agent on the door handle at his home. This operation is seen as so risky and sensitive that it is unlikely to have been undertaken without approval from the Kremlin, according to officials who have been briefed on the early findings of the inquiry.
This theory suggests that an assassin, who Britain believes was working on behalf of the Russian government, walked up to the door of Mr. Skripal’s brick home on a quiet street in Salisbury on March 4, the day that he and his daughter, Yulia, were sickened.
Mr. Skripal, who was freed in a spy swap with the United States in 2010, is still in critical condition and unresponsive, but Yulia is conscious and talking, according to a BBC report.
Because the nerve agent is so potent, the officials said, the task could have been carried out only by trained professionals familiar with chemical weapons. British and American officials are skeptical that independent actors could have carried out such a risky operation or obtained the agent without approval at the highest levels of the Russian government — almost exactly the same phrase that American intelligence agencies used in October 2016, when they first attributed the hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee to a team of Russian hackers.",LEFT
156579,Politico,"Trump considering 25 percent tax on car imports, citing national security","Trump considering 25 percent tax on car imports, citing national security
President Donald Trump wants to put a 25 percent tariff on imports of automobiles under a similar authority that allowed him to slap duties on imports of steel and aluminum in order to protect U.S. national security, a senior administration official confirmed.
The potential tariffs, which would only come after a lengthy investigation into the national security threat of imported automobiles, are being threatened at the same time as U.S. negotiators are trying to get Canada and Mexico to agree to demands that would overhaul NAFTA’s auto rules.
Story Continued Below
The investigation, which would run through the Commerce Department, could take several months to complete and would likely end with Commerce making recommendations on whether and how to restrict car imports, which Trump could then choose whether or not to accept.
Mexico and Canada are two of the three largest exporters of autos to the U.S. Trump has also repeatedly complained about auto imports from Germany and Japan, and has raised the issue in talks with world leaders.
Manufacturers of foreign brand autos like Toyota, Nissan and Aston Martin expressed alarm after The Wall Street Journal first reported Wednesday afternoon that the Trump administration is considering a hefty tax on imported cars to protect U.S. national security. The news outlet, quoting industry officials briefed on the broad outline of the plan, said the Trump administration is considering an inquiry to justify up to a 25 percent tariff on auto imports, which totaled $176 billion in 2017. That‘s exponentially larger than the imports of about $30 billion for steel and $18 billion for aluminum.

""If these reports are true, it’s a bad day for American consumers,"" John Bozzella, CEO of Global Automakers, said in a statement. ""The U.S. auto industry is thriving and growing. Thirteen, soon to be 14 companies, produced nearly 12 million cars and trucks in America last year. To our knowledge, no one is asking for this protection. This path leads inevitably to fewer choices and higher prices for cars and trucks in America.”
On Wednesday morning, Trump indicated some action is coming on autos, although it was unclear whether he was referring to ongoing talks with China, NAFTA negotiations with Canada and Mexico or something else.
""There will be big news coming soon for our great American Autoworkers. After many decades of losing your jobs to other countries, you have waited long enough!"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
Trump appeared to link a potential action on autos with NAFTA talks when he told reporters later on Wednesday that he felt the auto industry would “be very happy with what’s going to happen.”
“You'll be seeing very soon what I'm talking about,” he said before his trip to Long Island. “NAFTA is very difficult. Mexico has been very difficult to deal with. Canada has been very difficult to deal with. They have been taking advantage of the United States for a long time. I am not happy with their requests. But I will tell you, in the end, we win. We will win, and we'll win big.”
Trump has already imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum after a Commerce Department investigation determined that current imports of both metals were large enough to threaten the long-term viability of both domestic industries, thereby putting U.S. national security at risk. Any new inquiry would also rely on the so-called Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, a, gives the executive branch the ability to conduct investigations to “determine the effects on the national security of imports.”
Last year, the U.S. imported $43 billion worth of cars from Canada, $39 billion from Japan, $30 billion from Mexico, $21 billion from Germany, $16 billion from South Korea and additional amounts from other suppliers.
The White House, Commerce Department and Office of the U.S. Trade Representative did not respond to requests for comment.

170679,BBC,Relaxing visa rules for doctors and nurses,"Image copyright SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY
A letter to the prime minister from leading health think tanks is the latest plea for a rethink on visa rules that have affected NHS recruitment from outside the European Union. They argue that the NHS workforce is ""facing a crisis"" with shortages of key staff.
The chief executives of the King's Fund, the Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation have come together to make a joint submission to Downing Street ahead of the much-anticipated long-term plan for the NHS promised by Theresa May.
A policy aimed at limiting the number of skilled workers from outside the EU has been criticised by employers. An annual cap of 20,700 has led to thousands of workers, including NHS staff, being denied visas.
The BBC revealed that visas for 100 Indian doctors had been refused. They had been offered short-term contracts as part of a long-running scheme in the north-west of England that provides junior doctors to more than 20 NHS trusts.
Another BBC investigation showed that genetic counsellors, who identify people at risk of hereditary cancer and other serious conditions, were being turned down for visas even though there were workforce shortages.
Image copyright JEFF OVERS/BBC
The Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, has said he will review the visa system for skilled workers, after lobbying by some cabinet ministers. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme he was aware of the difficulties with NHS recruitment.
""I see the problem with that. It is something I'm taking a fresh look at,"" he said.
The think tanks' joint letter says there are ""worrying shortages of nurses, GPs and hospital doctors"". It adds: ""There is no option but to recruit more staff from overseas and to relax controls on visas.
""Nurses and some other health professionals, like radiographers, are on a shortage-occupation list, which means they are given priority in allocation of visas.
""But most doctors are not. And there has been a campaign by health employers to put all medical jobs on the shortage list or to take all NHS jobs temporarily out of the visa system.""
The think tank Global Future has produced analysis looking at the extent to which the NHS relies on overseas workers.
It says:
In the NHS in England, which employs about 1.2 million people in total, one in eight of those staff who have a known nationality - 12.5% - are from overseas
NHS staff in clinical roles are much more likely to come from abroad. About a quarter of doctors and 16% of nurses and health visitors are from overseas
Up to 45% of staff in some vital NHS specialties, including cardio-thoracic surgeons, paediatric cardiologists and neurosurgeons, are from outside the UK
Longer term, the lobbyists say, there needs to be a 10-year workforce strategy. And this must be given top priority and go ""hand-in-hand"" with the new funding settlement. They also call for real-terms funding increases of 4% per year. Anything less, they say, will compromise patient care and delay critical repairs to hospital buildings.
NHS leaders, in what looks like a planned campaign, have united behind the 4% per year figure. They fear that anything closer to 3%, which ministers may want to trumpet as a significant boost to NHS finances, won't allow any improvement to current shortcomings in the system, such as rising waiting lists.
They are up against the Treasury, which has wider issues to deal with in the public finances.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies has noted that making a chunky new investment in the NHS will have to be accommodated in the government's plan to balance the books by the mid-2020s.
""Unless it is able and willing to implement tax rises or further cuts to the social security budget over the rest of this Parliament, it is hard to see how a significant injection of additional cash into the NHS would be consistent with the government's stated fiscal objective,"" it says.
The uncertainty over the path of the economy and future borrowing requirements, adds the IFS, will make the Treasury even more cautious.
Expectation around the government's long-term NHS funding plan has been growing by the day.
And now added to the calls for higher year-on-year spending are the demands for changes to immigration rules for health workers. That's a lot for Theresa May to think about.",UNDEFINED

“I think we can look at a big picture now with some real definition,” Bernstein said, “in which [it’s a] perilous moment for our country right now.”
“It’s a question of whether lies, authoritarianism and the character of the president of the United States are going to take us to an authoritarian place where we have never been,” he continued, “in which he will bury a duly constituted and legal investigation that will determine whether or not the president is above the rule of law.”

179656,ABC News,Japan PM vows to resolve abduction by holding talks with Kim,"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met Thursday with families of people abducted by North Korea decades ago and pledged to deal directly with the North to resolve the issue.
Abe vowed to seek a summit with North Korea, but only when its leader is committed to resolving the abduction issue.
U.S. President Donald Trump said he raised the issue with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at their summit in Singapore on Tuesday, keeping his promise to Abe who had repeatedly sought Trump's help.
Abe said he will make use of the momentum to pursue the effort. ""I'm determined to deal with North Korea face-to-face and resolve the abduction issue,"" Abe told the families.
The mother of an abductee, Sakie Yokota, said it is important for Kim to be told of the problem. Her daughter Megumi was abducted from Japan's northern coast when she was 13. Yokota asked Abe to move quickly so elderly families can get their loved ones back while they are still alive.
""It's extremely significant that the North Korean leader was clearly reminded of the abduction issue,"" Yokota, 82, told reporters after meeting Abe. ""As we are all getting older and weaker, I told (Abe) that we are anxious to see our loved ones as soon as possible.""
Megumi is one of at least 17 Japanese that the government says were abducted in the 1970s and 1980s to North Korea to teach Japanese culture and language to agents.
After years of denials, North Korea acknowledged in 2002 abducting 13. It allowed five to temporarily visit Japan later that year, though they never returned. North Korea has said eight others, including Megumi, have died, but their families and Japan's government refuse to accept that due to a lack of proof.
