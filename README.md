# finetune_llama_causal_relationships
Google Colab notebook for finetuning llama on UniCausal dataset

# setup 
this notebook should work out of the box, only difference is you will note the google drive structure: 
`!pip install -r '/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/capstone/requirements.txt'`
So please update to your own folder structure. Just put this notebook and requirements.txt in whatever folder you want. I put mine in "capstone" folder.
