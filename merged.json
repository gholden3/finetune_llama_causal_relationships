Senior Goldman Sachs banker Jim Donovan is under strong consideration for deputy Treasury secretary and could serve as Mnuchins number two if confirmed by the Senate, people familiar with the matter said. Justin Muzinich, a former Morgan Stanley banker now at Muzinich & Co., is likely to take a senior position possibly as undersecretary for domestic finance or counselor, the people said. The counselor position would not require Senate confirmation. Story Continued Below Economist David Malpass, a veteran of the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, is expected to be nominated by President Trump to serve as undersecretary for international affairs. A White House spokesperson and a spokesperson for Mnuchin did not immediately return requests for comment on Sunday night. None of the selections are final. The trio would round out the top level at Treasury, which has been operating for weeks with limited staff including Adam Szubin, an Obama and George W. Bush administration holdover, as acting secretary. All three are well known both on Wall Street and in Washington. Malpass, who was an economic adviser to Trump during the 2016 campaign, also served as chief economist at Bear Stearns. Donovan, a Goldman partner and managing director, is close to Mitt Romney and served as one of the 2012 GOP nominees top fundraisers. He was also a top fundraiser and economic adviser for Jeb Bush in the 2016 campaign. He joined Goldman in 1993 and covered major clients in both investment banking and investment management. He made partner in 2000 and worked with then co-presidents John Thain and John Thornton on broader strategy for Goldman as a whole. For the last eight years, Donovan has also served as a professor of corporate strategy at the University of Virginia law school. Donovan would be the latest Goldman alum to join a Trump White House team that already includes several former executives of the bank including Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and senior Trump advisers Dina Powell and Stephen Bannon. The selection of Donovan, Muzinich and Malpass for the high-profile Treasury positions will likely draw fresh criticism from the left  and some on the populist right -- because of their association with Wall Street. Trump regularly criticized the financial industry during his populist run to the White House, singling out Goldman for specific criticisms. Trumps final ad of the campaign portrayed Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein as a sinister force of globalism. He criticized Ted Cruzs wife for her work at Goldman and his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, for her paid speeches to the powerhouse Wall Street bank. But for corporate executives and investors worried about the erratic nature of the Trump White House and the presidents inclination toward protectionism and a harsh approach to immigration, all three selections are likely to be viewed with relief. Both Malpass and Muzinich, who served as a top policy adviser to Jeb Bushs campaign, are well known both on Wall Street and among establishment Republicans in Washington. The Treasury Department is likely to play a key role as Trump develops a corporate and individual tax reform package with Republicans in Congress. Treasury also handles economic sanctions and currency issues and works with other departments on trade initiatives that are central to Trumps presidency. Mnuchin is viewed as less protectionist than Trump and some other West Wing advisers including Bannon. He and Cohn both come from more internationalist and trade-friendly backgrounds. The hope among many CEOs and financial industry executives is that they will help steer Trump away from trade wars while helping implement a policy of tax cuts, infrastructure investment and reduced regulations that could boost economic growth and continue a stock market rally that began following Trumps election.","article_id":"79070087","cause_effect":{"for corporate executives and investors worried about the erratic nature of the Trump White House and the presidents inclination toward protectionism and a harsh approach to immigration,":["Steve Mnuchin is viewed as less protectionist than President Donald Trump and some other West Wing advisers including Stephen Bannon."]}},{"id":"55208661","title":"Plant scientists have found a way to 'hack' photosynthesis. Here's why that's a big deal.","lead":"Scientists are hacking photosynthesis and reprogramming plants to make them grow bigger and faster, which could address food security issues around the world.","body":"By 2050, were pretty certain that we have to increase crops yields by anywhere from 25 to 70 percent to feed all the hungry people in the world, said Amanda Cavanagh, a postdoctoral researcher at the university and co-author of a new paper describing the research. We dont have another obvious way to increase yield other than taking a genetic engineering approach. To create the reprogrammed plants, Cavanagh and her colleagues zeroed in on RuBisCO, an enzyme plants use to capture carbon dioxide from the air and convert it into stems, leaves, roots and other plant matter. RuBisCO evolved about 3.5 billion years ago, at a time when there was no oxygen in the atmosphere. As a result, it's not particularly good at discriminating between carbon dioxide and oxygen. Sometimes it latches onto a molecule of oxygen rather than carbon dioxide. 'This is essentially anti-photosynthesis, and the plant produces a toxic compound that it has to recycle and detoxify,' said Donald Ort, a plant biologist at the University of Illinois and the studys senior author. The detoxification process requires plants to expend a lot of energy, meaning they have less to devote to growth. The scientists didn't modify the enzyme but changed the plants' DNA by inserting genes that simplify and speed up the detoxification process. As a result of the modification, the plants were able to grow bigger and more rapidly  a result seen in plants grown in the field as well as in greenhouses. Four unmodified plants (left) grow beside four plants (right) that were genetically engineered to make the process of photosynthesis more efficient. Claire Benjamin \/ RIPE Project The scientists worked initially with tobacco plants because they grow quickly and have genes that are easy to manipulate, Ort said. Now they're trying out their technique on potatoes, soybeans and cowpeas. Its too soon to know if these modifications have any drawbacks, but Ort said any enhanced crops would undergo rigorous testing before they are ever consumed by humans. Robert Blankenship, a biochemist at Washington University in St. Louis who wasn't involved with the research, called the results impressive and said the Illinois scientists' feat is a major advance. There are several approaches that people are using to improve the efficiency of photosynthesis, but I think this is one of the most promising and potentially beneficial, he said. There could be important benefits in areas of the world that have food security problems. Want more stories about the environment?

The Paulding County Sheriffs Office wrote in a Facebook post on Monday that K-9 Verro, an eight-year-old Belgian Malinois who was handled by Corporal Brandon Kilgore for more than seven years, was shot by another deputy who had been bitten from behind while he was running after a suspect. K-9 Verro was the kind of working dog that any handler would dream of,' the sheriffs office wrote. 'He had a high drive to fight crime and was relentless in his work ethic. Deputies said they responded to a domestic dispute Friday afternoon in Dallas, Ga., approximately 30 miles northwest of Atlanta, and spotted a man matching a suspect description inside a car.

Anyone that knew K-9 Verro knew how attached and protective he was of his handler, the Facebook post said. When Corporal Kilgore left his patrol vehicle chasing someone, K-9 Verro wanted to be with him as the two were inseparable. Deputies said K-9 Verro was able to squeeze through the partially open kennel door that separates his vehicle kennel from the drivers compartment and was then able to inch his way out of the vehicle through a window left partially open. Once outside, the sheriffs office said, K-9 Verro spotted a deputy running and since he could not differentiate between the deputy and the suspect without his handler present he apprehended the Deputy by grabbing the back of his leg and followed his training by biting and holding until he was commanded to release.

Chants of Fire Pantaleo! interrupted both de Blasio and Sen. Cory Bookers opening statements before the protesters were led out of the Fox Theatre. On July 16, the Justice Department declined to bring charges against Pantaleo, with U.S. Attorney General William Barr ordering that the case be dropped. Garners dying words, I cant breathe, became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014, and the aftermath of his death has become an example of how it is nearly impossible for families to receive justice from the state. Pantaleo has remained on paid desk duty in the five years since Garners death, which has caused activists and Garners family to sharply criticize de Blasio for not firing the officer. The mayor also waited until May of this year before pursuing formal disciplinary proceedings against Pantaleo. De Blasio has noted in the past that he cant legally fire Pantaleo. The law does state that the mayor cannot fire the officer, but he failed to intervene in other ways  mainly delaying an NYPD departmental trial until last year. In the case of Eric Garner, the Justice Department controls that situation right now, de Blasio said in 2016. Thats appropriate, and we yield to that. ASSOCIATED PRESS Later in the debate, following a contentious exchange between Booker and former Vice President Joe Biden on their equally unimpressive criminal justice histories, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro asked de Blasio, Why is that police officer still on the force, the one who killed Eric Garner? I know the Garner family, responded de Blasio. Theyve gone through extraordinary pain. Theyre waiting for justice and theyre going to get justice. Theres going to be justice. I have confidence in that. The mayor ended by saying that his administration was working to ensure that there will never be another tragedy because were changing fundamentally how we police. He also asked Biden if he had raised Garners case with President Barack Obama during his time in the White House. Biden didnt directly answer the question but pivoted back to defending himself against Bookers remarks on his role in fueling mass incarceration. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) kept the crux of her response short: He should be fired. He should be fired now. And Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) accused the Justice Department of thwarting the efforts of its civil rights division on the Garner case. That president didnt want those charges to go forward, said Harris.

Joel Jenkins was working as a Pike County deputy when Robert Rooker was fatally shot. Jenkins, of Waverly, testified he was forced to fire on March 28, 2015, because he thought Rooker was leaning down to grab a weapon. He said he thought Rooker was going to kill him. A Pike County jury deliberated about five hours before finding him not guilty. A defense attorney said Jenkins was justified in firing at Rooker, who had sped away from a traffic stop in his vehicle and tried to ram law enforcement vehicles. But special prosecutors from the state attorney general's office told jurors that Jenkins unnecessarily fired nine times through the windows of Rooker's stopped vehicle, hitting him seven times. Rooker's truck was already immobilized after the chase when it ended up pinned against a tree, and Rooker wasn't a threat when he was killed, prosecutors said. Jenkins later made up a story about how he thought Rooker had reached for a gun before he shot him, they said. Prosecutors were disappointed with the verdict but respect the jury's decision, a spokeswoman for the attorney general's office said. The shooting happened after a 17-mile pursuit of Rooker, whose blood alcohol content was more than twice the legal limit when he died. At the time of the shooting, Jenkins had been a deputy with the sheriff's office about two years. Jenkins also has pleaded not guilty to charges including involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a neighbor in December 2015. Authorities said Jenkins, who was off-duty at the time of that shooting, told them that he was showing Jason Brady a gun when it went off accidentally. That shooting occurred in Jenkins' home.

When a court sentenced Zhao, who'd wielded enormous power over his fellow citizens, to death for murder and corruption, state media hailed the ruling as evidence of equality before the law. Reports called it a milestone in the country's crackdown on misbehaving officials. Yet Zhao's brother is now questioning the verdict, saying the ex-official was abused in police custody and sentenced in a show trial  raising issues of justice that are rarely aired in politically sensitive, often tightly scripted cases. 'They want to execute my brother based on evidence that is too problematic,' Zhao Yifeng, a history professor at a university in the eastern city of Changchun, told The Associated Press. Zhao, who had enjoyed broad powers as head of public security in the northern Chinese region of Inner Mongolia, was sentenced to death in November for murder, accepting bribes and the possession of firearms. Zhao, who has denied the charges, appealed the sentence. The appeal was rejected by a higher court in Shanxi province in February. China's highest court, the Supreme People's Court, is now reviewing his death sentence, as it does for all capital punishment cases. Zhao's brother has written a detailed letter appealing for a fair trial and submitted it to the court through its 'letters and petitions' department, the office that is designated to hear citizens' complaints. 'This concerns my brother's life and whether the facts of this case have been made clear,' Zhao Yifeng said in a recent interview. Equally important, he added, 'It also concerns how the country's current judicial system is actually functioning.' The case has drawn a high level of public interest because Zhao is the first ministerial-level official to be sentenced to death in President Xi Jinping's hallmark crackdown on corruption that started in late 2012. Zhao, now 66, was found guilty of murdering a 27-year-old woman said to have had an 'intimate relationship' with him by shooting her on March 20, 2015, in the Inner Mongolian city of Chifeng, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of Beijing. Chinese media reports said Zhao had burned and buried the body of his mistress, identified only by her surname, Li, outside the city. They speculated that Zhao feared Li would expose him for some unspecified corruption. The court also said Zhao, who rose through the ranks of the police in the sparsely populated but resource-rich region over a three-decade career, used his leadership position from 2008 to 2010 to 'seek benefits' when promoting people and taking 24 million yuan ($3.5 million) in bribes. He was also convicted of illegally owning guns, bullets and detonators. Zhao's brother disputes only the murder charge, saying he does not know enough about the other charges to challenge the prosecution's arguments. He also points to violations of due process in the overall handling of the case. Zhao Yifeng said his brother was denied access to a lawyer in his first six months of custody despite his and his family's attempts to hire one for him. Interrogators used torture to extort a confession from Zhao, his brother said, citing a lawyer's record from reviewing the prosecution's case files and an interrogation video. In one session, Zhao was put through 22 hours of questioning with his chest, arms and legs strapped and cuffed to a chair in order to immobilize him, kept awake throughout and denied medication for a heart condition, according to his brother. Even after two years, Zhao has deep scars on his wrists, his brother said. He cites his brother as saying in court that the injuries were inflicted by interrogators who pressed down hard on his handcuffed wrists. In photos Zhao's brother hopes to submit to China's highest court, the former official is seen in a prison uniform extending his scarred wrists before him. He also says the courts ignored serious flaws in the prosecution's argument, including that none of the prosecution's three key witnesses identified Zhao as the killer in a police lineup. Zhao's defense lawyers raised these issues in their arguments. Yet, his brother says, they don't appear to have figured into the verdict, issued just days after the trial. 'This is a terrible thing, because what then is the point of the trial? It's all just a big performance,' Zhao Yifeng said. The Supreme People's Court, the two courts in Shanxi province where the case was tried, and police and prosecutors in Chifeng, where Zhao was interrogated, did not respond to repeated requests for comment sent by fax and phone. Zhao's appeal comes amid greater scrutiny of complaints of police abuse in China and problems with its judicial system, where courts have a 99 percent conviction rate  one of the highest in the world. Maya Wang, a researcher with New York-based Human Rights Watch, said it wouldn't be surprising if Zhao had been tortured while in police custody. 'The government doesn't give any statistics on the use of torture, but it is striking that such fate can befall almost anyone in China  whether we're talking about powerful former government officials or petty thieves,' Wang said. In recent months, Chinese activists have been drawing attention to the plight of a rights lawyer, Xie Yang, who told his attorneys that he had been subjected to sleep deprivation, punched, kicked and otherwise tortured during interrogations. Xie has been held since July 2015 in a crackdown on legal activism. Interrogators find it easy to sidestep government requirements aimed at curbing abuse because the police, prosecutors and judiciary are ultimately controlled by the Communist Party. 'They are required to work together to send suspects to jail, while the defense lawyer and the suspect have few rights and little power,' Wang said. Yet public pressure to curb abuses has grown following a string of wrongful convictions that recently came to light. China's highest court has pledged to do more to prevent the use of torture to obtain confessions, requiring interrogations to be videotaped, for example. But while the torture of ordinary people in police custody might trigger an outcry, there is little public sympathy for officials subjected to the same practices, part of a widespread perception that officials enjoy better treatment by police than ordinary suspects. The Supreme People's Court's verdict on Zhao's sentence is expected within weeks. In the meantime, Zhao Yifeng has been traveling regularly to Beijing seeking to win his brother a retrial. Sitting in his hotel room in Beijing, Zhao recalled how he and his older brother had been close as children but drifted apart in their adult years, separated by distance as well as differing views. 'I'm an academic and more of a liberal, which is unlike him,' he said. 'But if I could live this life again, I would stop my brother from getting into politics.'","article_id":"115860469","cause_effect":{"the ex-official was abused in police custody and sentenced in a show trial  raising issues of justice that are rarely aired in politically sensitive, often tightly scripted cases.":["Zhao's brother is now questioning the verdict,","Brother seeks retrial for China ex-police chief facing death"],"Zhao is the first ministerial-level official to be sentenced to death in President Xi Jinping's hallmark crackdown on corruption that started in late 2012.":["The case has drawn a high level of public interest"]}},{"id":"17951638","title":"Gaza conflict: Death toll mounts amid days of violence","lead":"Israel is continuing to hit hundreds of Gaza targets in retaliation for sustained rocket fire.","body":"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Rockets were seen in the sky above Ashkelon in Israel The death toll is mounting on both sides after three days of cross-border violence between Israel and militants on the Gaza strip. The most intense clashes in years have so far left at least four Israelis and 23 Palestinians dead. The Israeli army says more than 600 rockets have been fired into Israeli territory since Saturday, while it has hit 320 targets in response. Parts of the international community, including the UN, have called for calm. Reports on Sunday night suggest the UN, Qatar and Egypt are trying to broker a ceasefire. On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had ordered the military to 'continue its massive strikes on terror elements' in Gaza. Israel has said its air defence has intercepted more than 150 rockets so far. Mr Netanyahu says the country's forces around the strip would be 'stepped up with tank, artillery and infantry forces'.

Most of the deaths came on Sunday. The Islamic Jihad group said seven of the dead were its members. Civilians, including a 12-year-old boy and two pregnant women were also among those reportedly killed. Israel has contested the account of the death of one woman and her 14-month-old niece on Saturday. They blamed their deaths on a Palestinian rocket that fell short of its target. On Sunday, the Israeli military admitted a targeted assassination of a Hamas commander named Hamed Hamdan al-Khodari - sharing a video of the apparent moment they hit his car. The sites Israel says has destroyed include a multi-storey building in Gaza City, which it said included Hamas intelligence offices. Turkey said its state news agency Anadolu had an office there. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called Israeli strikes on civilians 'a crime against humanity'. On Sunday night, Hamas leader Ismail Haniya said in a statement that 'returning to a state of calm is possible' if Israel committed to a 'complete ceasefire'. Image copyright AFP Image caption A car, apparently belonging to Hamas militant, was one of the sites targeted by Israel on Sunday How did the latest violence develop? It began on Friday, during protests in Gaza against the blockade of the area - which Israel says is needed to stop weapons reaching militants. A Palestinian gunman shot and wounded two Israeli soldiers at the boundary fence. Israel retaliated with an air strike that killed two militants. The rocket barrage from Gaza began on Saturday morning. Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system shot down dozens of the rockets, but a number of homes in Israeli towns and villages were hit. How does the flare-up in violence compare? It is the one of the most surges in violence since the conflict of July and August 2014. In that year, Israel launched a ground offensive on Gaza following the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers. The conflict resulted in the death of 67 Israeli soldiers. Hamas and its allies launched more than 4,500 rocket strikes that killed six civilians in Israel. On the Palestinian side, 2,251 people, including 1,462 civilians, were killed in the seven-week conflict, according to the UN. Since then, Palestinian militants have continued to carry out sporadic strikes on Israel.

No fatalities were reported on either side. In early April a ceasefire was brokered by Egypt, but Hamas and allied militant groups later accused Israel of violating its terms. What has the reaction been? Nickolay Mladenov, the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, has condemned the recent violence and said the UN is working with both sides to calm the violence. In a statement, UN Chief Antonio Guterres has condemned 'in the strongest terms' rockets being launched into Israel. 'He urges all parties to exercise maximum restraint, immediately de-escalate and return to the understandings of the past few months,' the statement added. Speaking on Fox News on Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Israelis have 'every right to defend themselves' from rocket attacks. 'I hope we can return to the ceasefire that had been in place for weeks and had been holding significantly before this,' he added. The European Union on Sunday called for rocket fire to 'stop immediately'.

More than 130 structures were damaged by the Missouri River flooding at the base that houses the U.S. military's Strategic Command. Roughly 60 of those structures were damaged beyond repair and will need to be demolished, said John Henderson, assistant secretary of the Air Force for installations, environment and energy. 'It wasn't just the water, it was what was in the water,' Henderson told the Omaha World-Herald. The floodwaters ran as deep as 9 feet (2.7 meters) in some places and left behind a toxic sludge. The latest estimate is $70 million more than the initial estimate issued last month as part of the Air Force's $4.9 billion federal funding request for disaster relief. The call for emergency funding would also cover damage from Hurricane Michael nearly leveling Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida last fall. Henderson said $300 million would be designated to design and build new structures at the Offutt Air Force Base, while $120 million will go toward cleanup and the repair of structures that can be saved. Most of the new facilities will be built on higher ground, if possible, Henderson said. The two levees protecting Offutt that were overwhelmed by floodwaters this spring are slated to be raised through a $30 million project by the Papio-Missouri River Natural Resources District. Henderson said it's important for the two-year project to move forward. Construction was expected to begin this spring, but it's been pushed back because of flood damage to the levees. John Winkler, the district's general manager, said they're working with the Army Corps of Engineers to assess the damage. Winkler said crews will need dry weather and lowered river water levels to get started. ___ Information from: Omaha World-Herald, ","article_id":"4461062","cause_effect":{"More than 130 structures were damaged by the Missouri River flooding at the base that houses the U.S. military's Strategic Command.":["The Air Force is raising its cost estimate to $420 million to repair and rebuild at Nebraska's Offutt Air Force Base","Roughly 60 of those structures were damaged beyond repair and will need to be demolished,","Most of the new facilities will be built on higher ground, if possible,"]}},{"id":"113845837","title":"2 women stabbed, 1 fatally, near police officer at downtown Pittsburgh bus stop","lead":"Victims were wounded in front of a police officer Thursday morning; the suspect was taken into custody and no motive has been released","body":"Two women were stabbed, one fatally, right in front of a police officer Thursday morning in the middle of downtown Pittsburgh at a bus shelter. The incident was reported around 11:40 a.m., CBS Pittsburgh reports. The incident was nearby a Rite Aid, Burlington Coat Factory and the entrance to the Duquesne Club, a private social club. According to Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert, a police officer was patrolling the area when he noticed a woman sleeping under a bus shelter. The officer turned his patrol car around to check on the woman. Schubert said as the officer was talking with her, the suspect came around his back and struck the woman with a knife. The suspect then turned around and stabbed a second woman. Police say the officer jumped into action, disarming and arrested the suspect. 'The officer took immediate action, got the person down on the ground, got him in custody and then immediately started first aid on female to help her out,' Schubert said. The man was taken to Pittsburgh Police headquarters for questioning. Pittsburgh Public Safety officials say charges are likely. 'At this time there is no evidence to suggest that this attack was racially or religiously motivated,' the Pittsburgh Public Safety Department said. 'The woman at the bus stop was not wearing religious garb, but the second victim may have been wearing a hijab. Police are investigating and will explore all possible motives.'

An Indiana superintendent was arrested last week for insurance fraud, identity deception and official misconduct. But Casey Smitherman said she believed she was doing the right thing at the time. 'I would really like to go back and revisit that moment and change it, but I can't,' she said. Two weeks ago, she took a 15-year-old student who didn't have health insurance to a medical clinic. He had a very sore throat, so she passed him off as her son and paid for the clinic visit and prescription with her own health insurance. Casey Smitherman  'It's hard not to want to help all of our kids,' Smitherman said. In her school district, 78 percent of the kids qualify for free or reduced-cost lunches, so groups of teachers have identified struggling students to help with food, clothing and mentoring. Last Saturday, Smitherman told the police what she'd done and turned herself in. The police alerted prosecutor Rodney Cummings. 'I think there have to be some consequences, but they shouldn't be career jeopardizing. I think there's a way to take care of that without destroying her career, because her motives were good,' Cummings said.

Pacification on such a scale, however, was infeasible for the Saigon government to undertake, so only so-called priority villages  those near military bases, air fields, transportation arteries, and towns and cities  were subjected to pacification. Those under the control of Viet Cong were designated as free fire zones and bombed and shelled, under the assumption that anyone who lived there was Viet Cong by definition. The bombing and shelling drove people to flee into areas under government control in greater numbers. Statistics published in January 1975 by the Subcommittee to Investigate Problems Connected With Refugees and Escapees, part of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, indicated that the number of refugees registered by the government in 1965 was 772,000. This number grew to 906,000 in 1966. By 1967, the government had registered 2.1 million refugees. In addition to those the government registered  those placed in squalid camps of dilapidated huts  there were an estimated two million who were not registered, including about one million in Saigon. In mid-1967, Samuel Huntington of Harvard, working as a consultant to the State Department, visited Vietnam. On his return, he wrote an article in Foreign Affairs, The Bases of Accommodation, in which he stated that the most dramatic and far-reaching impact of the war in South Vietnam has been the tremendous shift in population from the countryside to the cities. He went on to say, In an absent-minded way the United States in Vietnam may well have stumbled upon the answer to the insurgency. The answer lies in forced-draft urbanization and modernization, which would drive the rural population from the villages into urban areas and deprive the insurgency the support it needed to generate enough strength to come to power.

Although Professor Huntington wrote that the social costs of this change have been dramatic and often heart-rending, he ultimately believed that the forced movement of peasants was a positive outcome. The article shocked many people and turned Mr. Huntington into a controversial figure among those opposed to the war. Nevertheless, his piece significantly influenced the latter phases of pacification. At first, pacification was left in the hands of the South Vietnamese armed forces. The policy changed in 1966 when the slow progress of pacification prompted an effort to speed it up, and the American Ninth Division was dispatched to Dinh Tuong, a province in the upper Mekong. The divisions mission was to act like a bulldozer, clearing the path for South Vietnamese officials and troops to move in and establish a government presence, and to keep the enemys main force units from disrupting that effort. The ferocious operations by the Ninth Division and its enormous firepower inflicted heavy civilian casualties, culminating in operation Speedy Express in 1969, during which American forces counted 10,000 Viet Cong killed but captured only 900 weapons. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In 1968, the insurgents carried the war to the towns and cities up and down the length and breadth of the country in the Tet offensive. American and South Vietnamese armed forces launched a furious counteroffensive, which inflicted additional destruction and casualties. Another million people were estimated to be displaced during the Tet offensive and another offensive in May 1968. The losses incurred by the Viet Cong during those counterattacks opened the way for the American and South Vietnamese governments to push an accelerated pacification program. The few restraints that had been in place to prevent indiscriminate killing of civilians were lifted, and the extensive use of firepower in populated areas was applied with deadly results to drain the pond to catch the fish. Over the next year, large areas of the countryside became depopulated. Besides registered and unregistered refugees who fled from their villages, the displaced included peasants who simply moved to another hamlet or area in a hamlet, or who moved to an open field, away from the clumps of trees and vegetation targeted by bombing and shelling. As an added precaution, they began to wear white clothing instead of the usual peasant black pajamas that Americans had come to associate with the Viet Cong, to avoid getting killed. In addition, there were also temporary refugees who moved in or out of a village for a few weeks at a time, or who would come back to their land occasionally to salvage what they could from their orchards. As part of accelerated pacification, the C.I.A. created the Phoenix Program to root out the Viet Cong infrastructure. Critics of Phoenix have called it an assassination program, aimed at Viet Cong cadres as well as innocent civilians. Besides killing guilty and innocent alike, Phoenix also provided local officials and policemen a sanctioned program to abuse power with false arrests, settling of scores and extortion. Phoenix did seriously damage the Viet Cong infrastructure, but the cost was high for the government as well, since the program sowed fear, resentment and distrust among the population. Pacification worked, in a narrow sense: By 1970, the Saigon government had control over a larger area of the country than it did five years before. However, the South Vietnamese Army, reluctant to take on Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces, relied even more on bombing and shelling to retain and enlarge the gains made during the high tide of American military intervention. It also resorted to forced relocation of peasants remaining in the heavily contested and Viet Cong areas, destroying or burning the houses of those who refused to move closer to the military posts that had been erected so that they could be kept under close surveillance. In the Central Highlands, Gen. Ngo Dzu, the regional commander, began an extensive program of forced relocation of the Montagnard ethnic minorities; given a few days notice, thousands of villagers had to abandon their homes and belongings and move to dismal resettlement centers, where they lacked housing, water and health care. Hundreds died after being forced to relocate. The cease-fire of 1973 did not bring peace to the battered rural area and its people. Before and after it went into effect, the government and the Communists each engaged in land-grabbing. The January 1975 report by the Senate subcommittee on refugees, issued a few months before the Communists defeated the South Vietnamese government and won the war, estimated that the total number of refugees had grown to 11.6 million. When the war ended, South Vietnam and its rural population had been profoundly transformed. Before fighting escalated, 80 percent of the people lived in the rural areas. By 1975, South Vietnam had gone through a forced-draft urbanization. The influx of refugees from the countryside into the urban areas had swelled their population, so that 65 percent of South Vietnamese were now living in towns and cities. The war had taken from the peasants who had been driven into urban areas to find safety what they cherished most: the land that their forebears had walked and tilled, and the homes that had sheltered them for generations. It had also shattered the families that had sustained them from birth. These were the things that had made their life whole before they became victims of the Americans forced-draft urbanization of their society, accomplished with bombing and shelling rather than with the industrialization that had urbanized and modernized the United States and other Western countries.","article_id":"4019293","cause_effect":{"The few restraints that had been in place to prevent indiscriminate killing of civilians were lifted, and the extensive use of firepower in populated areas was applied with deadly results to drain the pond to catch the fish.":["large areas of the countryside became depopulated.

Officers responded to one of the station's platforms just before 7 a.m. after getting a call from officers with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority about a man with a knife, LAPD Officer Drake Madison said. He said the LAPD officers used a less-than-lethal option before the shooting, though he didn't know whether that was a rubber bullet, a stun gun or another device. 'They attempted to deescalate, it didn't work and unfortunately an officer-involved shooting occurred,' Madison said. The man was pronounced dead at the scene. Madison didn't immediately have more details on what threat the man was posing and whether one or more officers fired their weapons. It's unclear how busy the platform was at the time of the shooting but the station is a major transportation portal. The platform where the shooting occurred takes people to and from Santa Monica, and across from that is the platform that goes to and from Long Beach. 'That's the first thing we were thinking of,' Madison said of the officers' mindset during the confrontation. 'On a work day at 6:52 a.m., it's going to be pretty busy down there.' Metro spokesman Rick Jager said he also didn't know exactly how many commuters were in the area, but said 'it's very fortunate there were no other injuries involved.' He said he didn't know whether the man had been threatening passengers before Metro officers called police, but did say the officers had an altercation with him beforehand.

Police fatally shot Fred Barragan after they said he pulled a gun as he ran from officers, while his family maintained he had been unarmed. The shooting sparked protests and led to a $475,000 settlement for Barragan's family.

The documents also stated that: Public exposure will put innocent bystanders, namely Mss. Lerners and Pazs family members (including young children), at risk, too. Lerner and Paz pointed to comments from Tea Party leader Mark Meckler that the lawsuit would treat the IRS like the criminal thugs they are.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions last month announced the Justice Department had entered into settlements with the Tea Party groups whose tax-exempt status was significantly delayed by the IRS dating back to 2013, based solely on their viewpoint or ideology. The settlements involved payments to the plaintiffs and an apology from the IRS. The IRSs use of these criteria as a basis for heightened scrutiny was wrong and should never have occurred, Sessions said in a statement at the time. It is improper for the IRS to single out groups for different treatment based on their names or ideological positions. The scandal drew heavy attention in 2013, when the IRS admitted it applied extra scrutiny to conservative groups applying for nonprofit status.

The move prompted criticism from rights groups and fears of possible violence, as Pride organizers said they would defy the ban. For more than a decade, the Istanbul Pride has attracted tens of thousands of participants, making it one of largest gatherings celebrating gay, lesbian and transgender rights and diversity in the Muslim world. Unlike other Muslim countries, homosexuality is not a crime in Turkey. However, lesbian, gay and transgender activists say they lack legal protections and face widespread social stigma in the nation that is heavily influenced by conservative and religious values. The Istanbul governor's office said the Pride march would be banned to keep public order and for the safety of participants and tourists. It said the area around central Taksim Square, where the march begins, was not designated for demonstrations. Related Image Expand \/ Collapse The volunteer-organized Pride committee said the ban violates domestic and international law limiting the right to peaceful assembly. It asked the governor's office to reconsider and fulfill its obligations by providing security precautions. The city government also said 'very serious reactions by different segments of society' were raised against the march. This week, like last year, ultra-nationalist and conservative groups said they would not allow the Pride march to take place even if the authorities allowed it. LGBTI activists said the ban legitimizes threats and hate speech under the guise of protecting the public's 'sensitivities.' Amnesty International expressed 'deep worry' following the ban and said Turkish authorities violated freedom of expression and assembly in a 'routine and arbitrary way.' 'Turkey should protect rather than ban Pride marches,' Amnesty said, adding it would make sure to document developments on Sunday. Up to 100,000 people took part in 2014's Pride march, making it one of the largest LGBTI Pride events in a predominantly Muslim nation. The following year, authorities banned the march in a surprise move citing public order and dispersed the crowds. In 2016, the march was again banned amid a spate of deadly attacks blamed on the Islamic State group or on outlawed Kurdish militants. LGBTI activists still attempted to converge on Taksim Square, leading to skirmishes with police. A state of emergency declared after last summer's failed coup has further limited public gatherings. Organizers believe the celebrations in 2015 and 2016 were banned because they coincided with Islam's holy month of Ramadan and say authorities are using security as an excuse to ban the parades instead of taking measures to deal with the threats against those participating. Sunday's planned march coincides with the Eid holiday, marking the end of a month of fasting for Ramadan. '(The bans are) a reflection of the increasingly conservative and majoritarian policies of the government,' said Murat Koylu, of the Ankara-based Kaos GL, a group promoting LGBTI rights. The Pride Week events and parade, held in Istanbul since 2003, allowed the LGBTI community to try and break the stigma and assert their rights, including demands for explicit bans on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. 'The fact that the existing political power is not making the necessary changes in the constitution, and the fact that they have discourse against us might encourage people who are already (trans) phobic,' said Seyhan Arman, a 37-year-old transgender woman and performer. The Turkish government insists there is no discrimination against individuals based on their sexual orientation, and that laws barring discrimination on the basis of gender, race, ethnicity or religion protect all citizens. It also insists that perpetrators of hate crimes are prosecuted. 'The violence against us has existed since the day we were born. It starts in the family, it continues at the university, in the working life,' said Deniz Sapka, a 27-year-old transgender woman originally from the southeastern province of Hakkari, who goes by that surname to avoid recognition by family members. 'We are people who have always experienced a state of emergency. We experience it from our birth.'","article_id":"4461149","cause_effect":{"Turkey bans Istanbul Pride,":["organizers vow to march anyway"]}},{"id":"4518099","title":"US solider dies at Fort Bragg after collapsing during training","lead":"A 29-year-old Fort Bragg soldier died Tuesday after collapsing during physical training, officials said.","body":"A 29-year-old Fort Bragg soldier died Tuesday after collapsing during physical training, officials said.

What about ham or bacon? As evidence mounts up about the serious health implications of eating red and processed meats, including increased risk of cancer, researchers are calling for a meat tax. The idea, set out in research from the University of Oxford published on Tuesday, is that a meat tax could both reduce deaths and raise the money needed to cover the health costs of our consumption. If something is classified as carcinogenic, there is rationale for governments to regulate that, minimizing risk exposure to citizens, thats one of the responsibilities of governments, Marco Springmann of the University of Oxford told . Governments around the world already use taxes to discourage what are considered harmful behaviors, such as smoking, using single-use plastic bags or drinking sweetened drinks. Could meat be added to the list? Here we take a look at the reasons for a meat tax, how it would work and whether it could be implemented. Whats wrong with eating meat? It depends what type of meat youre eating. Eating meat does have health benefits, but were eating too much of it. And the wrong kind. When it comes to red meat and processed meat, there is increasing evidence that eating too much of it can have pretty heavy health consequences. Red meat  which includes beef, lamb and pork  has been labeled by the World Health Organzation as probably carcinogenic for humans. Processed meat  for example, hot dogs, ham and sausages  is deemed carcinogenic. In other words, there is convincing evidence it causes cancer, according to the WHO. izikMd via Getty Images Processed meats such as sausages have been linked to cancer. While statistics are hard to come by for red meats, about 34,000 cancer deaths a year are attributable to diets heavy in processed meats, according to the Global Burden of Disease project. The most common type of cancer associated with these types of meat is colorectal cancer, but its also been linked to heart disease, diabetes and strokes. According to the new study, by 2020 there will be 2.4 million deaths attributable to eating red and processed meats. Of course, its not just about health. Meat has a huge environmental footprint too. Livestock accounts for 14.5 percent of human-related greenhouse gas emissions and recent research from the journal Science suggested that the best thing you can do for the planet is to stop eating meat and dairy. How much would it be? The researchers analyzed 149 countries to calculate how much extra we should be paying for meat, if we want to pay the true cost. And its quite staggering. To cover the health costs, processed meats should cost 25 percent more on average. In lower income countries, prices would only need to rise by 1 percent, the study says, but in richer countries, it recommends price increases of more than 100 percent. Average prices for red meat would increase by 4 percent. In the U.S. the taxes would be high, with 163 percent on processed meat and just under 34 percent on red meat. What could be the outcome? The research suggests that it could prevent more than 220,000 deaths and save $40 billion in health care costs every year. They estimate tax revenues could cover 70 percent of the costs spent by countries on dealing with the health implications of these types of meat. In terms of environmental impact, Springmann said their analysis found that global taxation of red and processed meats at the level they suggest could reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by more than 100 megatons, so thats comparable to technological mitigation measures that have been looked at. Wont this hit low-income people hardest? Thats the criticism. Making food more expensive for everyone will obviously have the most negative impact on those with the least to spend. Often processed meats can be the lowest-price option for low-income families looking for cheap sources of protein. And some studies have suggested there is a cost to eating more healthily. But Springmann counters this by drawing a comparison to soda taxes, What people have found with the sugar drinks tax, it would actually help low income-households more because they would have a higher incentive of switching to other, more healthy alternatives. Baloncici via Getty Images He says the tax needs to be complemented by information campaigns and other initiatives such as cooking classes that show its easy and affordable to switch diets. Most of the time people dont know what they should consume instead. So its very important to show them what are the alternatives. Has anyone done it? Yes. Denmark implemented a tax on saturated fats in 2011, which can be seen as a meat tax in effect, as meat is high in saturated fats. But, after a backlash, it was abolished after a year. Research published in Nature found that, during its short life, it did encourage healthier eating. The tax resulted in a 4 percent reduction in saturated fat intake and an increase in vegetable consumption. It has a fairly lukewarm conclusion that the tax made a positive, but minor, contribution to public health in Denmark. Springmann said the lesson to be learned from this case study is that its really important to communicate it well. If people understand what revenues are used for, he says, the tax is viewed more positively. In Springmanns study, meat tax revenues would be used to cover health costs, but they could equally be used to support farmers and butchers in making a shift away from meat, or to subsidize fruit and vegetables. Whats the likelihood of it being implemented in the U.S.? At the moment, low. The closest thing to a meat tax in existence in parts of the U.S. may well be soda taxes. Philadelphia, Seattle and Boulder are among the cities to introduce taxes on sugary drinks. But its not a federal policy and has seen very strong pushback from soda companies. During the midterms, $20 million was raised in Washington state alone to support a ballot proposition that would bar cities from passing any new taxes on grocery items. Soda companies such as Coca-Cola and Pepsico contributed 98 percent. Any meat tax would face extremely strong opposition from farming lobbies. And the current administration is not exactly keen on taxes.","article_id":"3928746","cause_effect":{"Meat Tax":["could both reduce deaths and raise the money needed to cover the health costs of our consumption."],"could both reduce deaths and raise the money needed to cover the health costs of our consumption.":["classified as carcinogenic,"]}},{"id":"4390977","title":"Off-duty NYPD officer dies of suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound: police","lead":"An off-duty New York City police officer was found dead Saturday afternoon of a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound.","body":"[Editor's note: This story discusses suicide.

The videos, presented by pro-life organization Live Action and narrated by former abortionist-turned-pro-life activist Dr. Anthony Levatino, show animations of how abortions are performed during various stages of pregnancy. The middle school presentation also included a music video titled Can I Live? in which rapper Nick Cannon thanks his mother for not aborting him when she became pregnant as a teen. A sample video is below: According to the Sacramento Bee, Alex Barrios, a spokesman for the school district, said the videos are completely inappropriate for the classroom and fail to meet the districts approved family life and sexuality curriculum. He added the district will address this matter with the seriousness it demands. Parents of children who saw the videos complained to the district. They identified the teacher as Jenny Thomas, a science teacher tasked with teaching about family life and human sexuality. Parents reportedly described Thomas as a good teacher. The districts policies, reports the Bee, say family life and sex ed classes should help students understand the biological, psychological, social, moral and ethical aspects of human sexuality and shall comply with the requirements of law and administrative regulation. The report continues: The districts governing board believes that students should have opportunities to discuss controversial issues which have political, social or economic significance and which the students are mature enough to investigate and address, the policy reads. The curriculum should help students learn how to gather and organize pertinent facts, discriminate between fact and fiction, draw intelligent conclusions and respect the opinions of others. Teachers should exercise caution and discretion in deciding whether a particular issue is suitable for study or discussion, the policy says. The governing board expects teachers to ensure that all sides of a controversial issue are impartially presented. The school district states California law  the California Healthy Youth Act  requires comprehensive sexual health education and HIV prevention education be provided to students at least once in middle school and once in high school, starting in 7th grade. Instruction must encourage students to communicate with parents, guardians or other trusted adults about human sexuality, the district continues. Instruction must be medically accurate, ageappropriate and inclusive of all students. The following topics are required to be included in sex education: Information about HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including transmission, FDA approved methods to prevent HIV and STIs, and treatment Information that abstinence is the only certain way to prevent unintended pregnancy and HIV and other STIs, and information about value of delaying sexual activity Discussion about social views of HIV and AIDS Information about accessing resources for sexual and reproductive health care Information about pregnancy, including FDA approved prevention methods, pregnancy outcomes, prenatal care, and the newborn safe surrender law Information about sexual orientation and gender, including the harm of negative gender stereotypes Information about healthy relationships and avoiding unhealthy behaviors and situations The middle school grade seven curriculum provides for teachers to demonstrate how to use a male condom.

People demonstrate against the killing of protesting children, who were shot dead when security forces broke up a student protest in Khartoum, Sudan August 1, 2019. \/Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah Organizers had called for a million-person march in cities across Sudan in response to the killing of young protesters in El-Obeid, southwest of the capital Khartoum, earlier this week. Sudan has been gripped by months of political turmoil that climaxed in the army overthrowing long-time leader Omar al-Bashir in April. Protesters have kept up their rallies since then, pressing the army to hand over to civilians, accusing the security services of violence and decrying the shortages and economic hardships that triggered the unrest in the first place. Thursdays killings, reported by the Central Committee of Sudan Doctors, one of the main protest groups, came as opposition leaders said there had been some progress in talks with the military on a deal to form a new government after Bashirs ousting. Despite signing a deal in July which secured a three-year transition period and a joint sovereign council with a rotating leadership, talks over the wording of a constitutional declaration on the changes have stumbled. The agreement is really now just around the corner, Satea al-Hajj, a leader in the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) coalition of opposition groups, said in a press conference in Khartoum on Thursday. Negotiations over the declaration began again late on Thursday night. ITS TOO BAD The opposition had demanded that members of the sovereign council, which is intended to lead the country until elections are held, should not be granted blanket immunity from prosecution for past crimes. But FFC leaders said on Thursday they had agreed that they could be granted only procedural immunity - meaning top officials could be tried with the permission of two-thirds of the legislative council. The opposition leaders said both sides also agreed another key point, reaffirming that the parties included in the FFC would have 67% of the legislative council while the rest will be granted to other opposition and political groups. Sudans ruling military council did not immediately confirm the details of the agreements. In Omdurman, across the Nile from Khartoum, protesters chanted its too bad, its too bad, we dont have an army, expressing anger at the army for not protecting protesters. Footage posted on social media also showed protests breaking out in El-Obeid, the state capital of North Kordofan state, and Wad Medani, the state capital of Jazeera state, southeast of the capital on the Blue Nile. The FFC has accused military and paramilitary forces of firing on the high school pupils as they protested over bread and fuel shortages in El-Obeid on Monday. The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), the main protest group and a leading voice in the FFC, accused the military of failing to protect civilians and of either being complicit in or neglecting to protect against roadblocks preventing the masses from achieving the goals of the revolution. A senior army commander said a security force assigned to guard a bank was responsible for killing children protesting near there, the official SUNA news agency reported on Thursday. The bank guards were a government security force. Slideshow (4 Images) Opposition groups have also accused the main paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces, of killing scores of protesters since Bashir was ousted and the RSFs role remains a point of contention. The FFC said on Thursday that the RSF should be merged into the armed forces, a proposal opposed by Sudans ruling generals, said al-Hajj.","article_id":"1667232","cause_effect":{"Four killed":["gunfire"],"gunfire":["Sudan protests,"]}},{"id":"113857119","title":"Activists seek freedom for Cyntoia Brown, doing life for murder when she was 16","lead":"Backers say Cyntoia Brown was sex trafficking victim when she shot and killed man who solicited her; prosecutors say she wanted to rob him","body":"NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- More than a dozen national advocacy groups want the release of a Tennessee woman imprisoned for life after she shot and killed a man who solicited her as a teenage prostitute. According to The Tennessean, Cyntoia Brown received support in a federal appeals court brief by the Southern Poverty Law Center, The Sentencing Project, the Center for Wrongful Convictions of Youth and others. Brown has been in prison since 2004, when she was convicted of killing the 43-year-old man who solicited her. With support from several celebrities, her appeal addresses her sentence's constitutionality and says she lacked the mental capacity for a murder conviction. Brown's advocates say she was a 16-year-old sex trafficking victim. Prosecutors say Brown killed the man to rob him. Brown isn't parole eligible until she's 67.

Bill Haslam to release Brown.

'But when you look at all the factors that led her to that place, she was being victimized by an older man who was her pimp, who was beating her, threatening her, and abusing her emotionally, physically, and sexually. I think most people would not be able to protect themselves in those situations if they were 16 years old.' Advocates say it's time for Brown to be treated as a sex trafficking victim, not a criminal. 'She has demonstrated her remorse for what she did and has dedicated herself to an education,' said attorney Charles Bone, who has represented Brown pro bono for seven years. 'We think it's time for her to be considered for a drastically reduced sentence.'

A neighbour of Allan Chappelow, the murdered man, who came forward after reading a Guardian article on the case, told the court that he and his family had been threatened with death by an intruder after Yam was taken into custody. The court heard from three new witnesses, including one who said Chappelow was a regular visitor to the spanking bench on Hampstead Heath, a spot frequented by gay men. Yam was convicted of Chappelows murder at the Old Bailey in London in 2009 after a retrial during which his defence was heard in secret. The government had claimed this was necessary to protect national security. It is believed to be the first murder trial in which a secrecy order was imposed for such a reason. On Tuesday, the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas, sitting with Mr Justice Sweeney and Mrs Justice May, reserved judgment and said a decision would be made as soon as possible. Chappelow, an 86-year-old author and photographer, was found dead in his crumbling home at Downshire Hill near Hampstead Heath in north London in June 2006, after police had been alerted by his bank following suspicious transactions. He had been beaten and had been dead for some time. Use of his stolen credit cards was traced to Yam, who lived nearby. He was later arrested in Switzerland. At his trial in 2008, the prosecution suggested that Yam must have been confronted by Chappelow when stealing from his postbox and could have then entered the house and killed him. He was convicted of theft and fraud, and sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison, but the jury could not reach a decision on the murder charge. At a second trial the following year, he was convicted of murder and jailed for a minimum of 20 years. Jonathan Bean, a neighbour of Chappelow, told the court that soon after the murder and with Yam in custody, he heard a rustling noise at his front door and saw a glimpse of a knife. An intruder told him: Do not call the police or we will kill your wife and baby. He said: I was completely terrified, because in my mind my neighbour had recently been killed in similar circumstances. Bean called police and moved his family to stay with friends. He told officers about his fears, but they were adamant that the intruder was not connected to the murder. After reading an article in  about the case in 2014, he gave a statement to Yams lawyers. As a result, the Criminal Cases Review Commission referred the case to the court of appeal. Another witness, Peter Hall, told the court that he was a regular visitor to the spanking bench and had seen Chappelow there frequently over a number of years until shortly before his death. I hardly recall a time when he wasnt there, he said. He would spank the bench with a paddle or belt to attract likeminded people  He also had an improvised cat-o-nine-tails. On two occasions, he saw Chappelow leave with young men. A third witness, Michael Dunn, described seeing a man acting suspiciously and entering Chappelows property around the time of his murder. The man told him that Chappelow had recently driven to Liverpool for a book sale on his motorbike, which Dunn said was covered with foliage and had clearly not been used for years. He told police about this at the time, but said an officer walked off. Peter Wilcock QC, representing Yam, said: Beans evidence would have had a dramatic impact on the jury. There were signs that other people were in the premises. He referred to footprints and cigarette butts that had no DNA or forensic link to Yam. The prosecution case was that Yam acted alone and was responsible for the murder and theft. Everything stopped when Wang Yam was arrested, Wilcock said, referring to police not pursuing the new evidence. He added that there is absolutely no direct evidence that Wang Yam was involved in the murder. Duncan Atkinson QC, for the crown, said there is no evidence that anyone else benefited from the fraud, adding that the new evidence would not have made a difference to the jurys verdict. Wang, 56, a grandson of one of Mao Zedongs deputies, was a research assistant at the Chinese nuclear weapons research institute. He fled China via Hong Kong and was granted refugee status in Britain in 1992. It is accepted that he was an MI6 informant. In advance of his trial in 2008, the then home secretary Jacqui Smith signed public interest immunity certificates to prohibit reporting of the case. William Hague claimed that there would be a real risk of serious harm to an important public interest if Wang were allowed to disclose evidence heard in secret.","article_id":"39164439","cause_effect":{"Chinese MI6 informant":["dramatic impact on jury"],"dramatic impact on jury":["Fresh evidence"],"Fresh evidence":["secret trial"]}},{"id":"38977790","title":"Boy, two, and parents suffer burns after acid attack in north London","lead":"Police appeal for information after family had strong acid thrown on them in Islington on Saturday afternoon","body":"Police appeal for information after family had strong acid thrown on them in Islington on Saturday afternoon A father, mother and their two-year-old son have suffered burns following an acid attack in north London.

The police chief described the clashes as very tense, saying: I have not seen such scenes for a long time. He said police had taken a tolerant attitude at first and it was not until protesters charged cordon lines with sharpened iron poles, bricks and metal barricades to attack officers at scene that the force had responded. Protesters blocked and occupied roads around Admiralty, including Lung Wo Road, Tim Mei Avenue, Harcourt Road and Gloucester Road, causing severe traffic congestion. Although it was already an illegal assembly, we tried to be tolerant, Lo said. But some rioters used violent measures to storm the Legislative Council Complex. Police escalated the use of force to control the situation, disperse the crowds and protect those working in the Legislative Council complex, Lo said. We the officers and you are all Hong Kong people. And we share the same vision to maintain law and order and it is our responsibility to make Hong Kong a safe place for people to live, he said.

According to court documents filed in Florida federal court, Capt. John R. Nettleton faces two counts of obstruction of justice, one count of concealment of material facts, two counts of falsification of records and five counts of making false statements to investigators looking into the death of Christopher Tur. According to the indictment, Tur disappeared on the night of Jan. 9, 2015 after attending a party at which he accused Nettleton of having an affair with Tur's wife. Tur's body was found in the waters of Guantanamo Bay two days later, on Jan. 11. Prosecutors claim Nettleton lied to investigators about an affair with Tur's wife, as well as getting into a physical altercation with Tur following the party. The indictment also says that investigators found a paper towel stained with Tur's blood near a pier in Nettleton's backyard on the base. According to the document, Nettleton was close by when investigators recovered the paper towel and told them, 'That's probably nothing.' Investigators later found bloodstains that matched Tur's DNA in Nettleton's home.

Nettleton is innocent and he looks forward to the opportunity to rebut these allegations in court. This is something that has been hanging over his head for a long time.'

Nelson Moncada, 37, was shot several times and then robbed of his belongings in a Caracas district that has been the frequent site of clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces. His murder brings to 61 the number of number of deaths associated with protests that erupted on 1 May. Victims have included supporters on both sides, bystanders and members of the security forces. Moncada was on his way home late on Wednesday night when he was set upon at one of the many barricades thrown up on the citys streets. Venezuela ranks amongst the top three most murderous countries in the world with as many as 91 per 100,000 residents, according to local NGOs. On the frontline of Venezuela's punishing protests Read more But it is unclear whether Moncada was the victim of common criminals, or if he was targeted for political reasons. The murder came amid some of the worst street violence in the city in this wave of unrest. Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters were dispersed by national guardsmen who fired tears gas canisters and rubber bullets. Photos widely circulated on social media showed National Guard firing into the crowd at close range. Such skirmishes have occurred nearly every day since president Nicolas Maduro moved to consolidate his rule in March and often continue after nightfall, with protesters building and setting fire to barricades of debris, fallen trees and even cars and trucks. The general attorneys office confirmed Moncadas death on Twitter, saying that the judge had been killed after trying to avoid a barricade. One local crime reporter, said he was shot while trying to escape a criminal gang that operates in one of the most dangerous slums of Caracas. Others claimed Moncada was accidentally shot by government supporters seeking to intimidate demonstrators, while government supporters took to social media to blame the opposition for what they called an act of revenge. Defense minister Nestor Reverol suggested on Thursday that Moncada could have been the victim of hitmen hired by the opposition. The victim was intercepted by several subjects who were at a barricade and he was attacked and killed by them (...) but we are not ruling out the possibility that this was a hit job hired by the terrorist right, he said. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Protestors block the highway in Caracas. Photograph: Anadolu Agency\/Getty Images Reverol speculated that Moncada might have been targeted because he was one of several judges who who upheld a 14-year prison sentence against opposition leader, Leopoldo Lopez who was convicted on charges of inciting violence during a previous wave of anti-government protests in 2014. Moncada also served as judge in the controversial case of Bassil Da Costa, a university student who was shot during those protests. The judges death  and the conflicting accounts of his murder  highlight how divided Venezuelan society has become, and how the protests have exacerbated the countrys crime problem. Reports of petty crime during demonstrations have become increasingly frequent. Protesters have taken to social media to denounce that thieves are infiltrating the marches and using the chaos to rob people of their cell phones and other belongings. Police have warned that criminals bands are posing as protesters, but security forces have also been photographed robbing demostrators and members of the press. Venezuela: man set on fire during anti-government protests Read more Pro-government militias, known as colectivos, have also been filmed firing on protesters and robbing vehicles. Last year, demonstrators set a man on fire after accusing him of robbing people in the marches. President Nicolas Maduro said the lynching was prompted by racial hatred, while government critics say the attack demonstrates the total absence of any rule of law. Since the protests first exploded in early April, hundreds of people on both bands have been injured, and close to 3,000 detained. Anti-government demonstrators are demanding an electoral calendar and the release of the more than 130 political prisoners. President Maduro has called the demonstrators terrorists and accused the US of trying to force him from office.","article_id":"38917124","cause_effect":{"Nelson Moncada, who had been involved in several high-profile cases,":["A Venezuelan judge has been shot and killed as he approached a street barricade in Caracas,"],"A Venezuelan judge has been shot and killed as he approached a street barricade in Caracas,":["Nelson Moncada, 37, was shot several times and then robbed of his belongings in a Caracas district"]}},{"id":"4339649","title":"High School Teacher Accused of 12 Sex Crimes Involving 3 Students","lead":"Authorities arrested an Alabama high school teacher Wednesday, accusing her of committing 12 sex crimes against three different students.","body":"Authorities arrested an Alabama high school teacher Wednesday, accusing her of committing 12 sex crimes against three different students.

'The Order is premised on a misreading of federal statutory law and departs dramatically from settled constitutional principles,' the lawsuit, filed by Seattle Mayor Ed Murray and City Attorney Pete Holmes, states. The suit challenges the legality of the executive order, signed by Trump in late January, that takes aim at so-called 'sanctuary' jurisdictions by threatening to withhold federal grants. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a news briefing the order will 'strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants.' A sanctuary city is a broad term that refers to cities or states with policies in place that limit involvement in federal immigration enforcement. The Trump administration has argued that cities should collect the citizenship status of its residents and report that information to federal officials. Suit claims order 'unclear' But many large cities, including Seattle, limit the collection of citizenship information by its local law enforcement, which is not actively required by federal law. These cities also largely do not honor requests from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to detain individuals beyond what is allowed by criminal proceedings. These cities argue that immigrants are more willing to cooperate with law enforcement and seek health assistance if they do not fear they may be deported when doing so. The suit has two main thrusts. First, it argues, Seattle is not in violation of the relevant federal statute, known as Section 1373. And second, the executive order's meaning is unclear and it is unconstitutional, as it violates the 10th amendment. 'It uses terms that are vague and not defined, does not spell out the particular enforcement objectives of the Secretary and Attorney General, and does not describe in an intelligible manner the federal Executive Branch's understanding of the requirements purportedly imposed by Section 1373,' the lawsuit reads. Mayor: City will stand with immigrants, refugees The order also violates the Spending Clause, the lawsuit argues, and is causing 'immediate harm' to Seattle by hampering its budget process. About $55 million of Seattle's 2017 operating expenses comes from federal funding, and more funding is dedicated to longer-term capital investments, the city said. In a statement, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said the city will continue to stand with its immigrant and refugee populations. 'Seattle will not be bullied by this White House or this administration and today we are taking legal action against President Trump's unconstitutional order,' he said. The lawsuit names Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly as defendants.","article_id":"4964787","cause_effect":{"President Donald Trump's executive order on so-called sanctuary cities,":["Seattle sues Trump over 'fatally ambiguous' order on sanctuary cities","The city of Seattle has filed a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's executive order on so-called sanctuary cities,"],"the executive order, signed by Trump in late January, that takes aim at so-called 'sanctuary' jurisdictions by threatening to withhold federal grants.":["Seattle sues Trump over 'fatally ambiguous' order on sanctuary cities","The city of Seattle has filed a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's executive order on so-called sanctuary cities,"]}},{"id":"4439165","title":"Ohio couple accused of binding, gagging twin boys","lead":"An Ohio couple is accused of binding and gagging 4-year-old twin boys with duct tape to discipline them, leaving police officers deeply disturbed when they discovered the horrific scene on Sunday, police said.","body":"An Ohio couple is accused of binding and gagging 4-year-old twin boys with duct tape to discipline them, leaving police officers deeply disturbed when they discovered the horrific scene on Sunday, police said.

In March, Grand Prairie police arrested Rebecca Goerdel, 28, after an investigation revealed the second year special education teacher at the Young Mens Leadership Academy at Kennedy Middle School behaved inappropriately with an eighth-grader during the 2016-17 academic year. advertisement  Texas reported that Grand Prairie Independent School District officials learned of her alleged improper attachment to the boy after school dismissal on March 10. They placed Goerdel on administrative leave immediately. Local law enforcement then launched a probe which resulted in her arrest. Grand Prairie police found sexually explicit text messages between Goerdel and the underage boy, some which were from third party apps that have seen been deleted, according to WFAA. On March 11, a detective texted Goerdel from the boys phone. Believing it was the boy, she responded by asking him to spend the night with her. An arrest warrant also alleged that Goerdel acted inappropriately by sitting on the boys lap in her car and they made out but she said they never had sex. The improper sexual relationship purportedly began in January when Goerdel sent a nude photo of herself in a tanning bed to the minor and asked him to sketch a picture of her. On March 24, Grand Prairie ISD Superintendent Susan Hull said in a statement: This kind of conduct is outrageous and will not be tolerated. She continued: The teacher-student relationship is sacred. It reflects a vow from teachers to parents that their children are safe  as safe as they would be at home. When a teacher in Grand Prairie ISD breaks that vow, he or she will be dealt with quickly and aggressively. I encourage law enforcement to pursue all available action. After the grand jury handed down this weeks indictment, Grand Prairie ISD officials released a similar statement to the one they issued in March. This time, though, the school district added they were pleased that law enforcement has doggedly pursued this matter and that Goerdel is being held responsible for her conduct. On September 1, the state implemented Senate Bill 7, the new deterrent law aimed at curbing incidences of inappropriate teacher and student sexual misconduct, although it applies to all education professionals who wantonly engage with students, a problem which has escalated in Texas public schools over the past eight years. SB 7 mandates that educators attend ongoing professional development classes that reinforce appropriate boundaries, relationships, and communications with students. Since many of these illicit relationships start over social media, spiraling off into lewd text messaging and sexual activity, the law requires that school districts adopt written policies defining appropriate electronic communications among campus faculty, staff members, and students.

We are concerned, from a range of academic perspectives, about proposed governmental reforms to the Gender Recognition Act, and their interaction with the Equality Act. Our subject areas include: sociology, philosophy, law, criminology, evidence-informed policy, medicine, psychology, education, history, English, social work, computer science, cognitive science, anthropology, political science, economics, and history of art. This week, following an opportunity offered to us by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, we have submitted to the consultation a number of letters, outlining, as individuals, concerns about the introduction of self-ID for gender reassignment. We are also concerned about the suppression of proper academic analysis and discussion of the social phenomenon of transgenderism, and its multiple causes and effects. Members of our group have experienced campus protests, calls for dismissal in the press, harassment, foiled plots to bring about dismissal, no-platforming, and attempts to censor academic research and publications. Such attacks are out of line with the ordinary reception of critical ideas in the academy, where it is normally accepted that disagreement is reasonable and even productive. Many of our universities have close links with trans advocacy organisations who provide training of academics and management, and who, it is reasonable to suppose, influence university policy through these links. Definitions used by these organisations of what counts as transphobic can be dangerously all-encompassing and go well beyond what a reasonable law would describe. They would not withstand academic analysis, and yet their effect is to curtail academic freedom and facilitate the censoring of academic work. We also worry about the effect of such definitions on the success rates of journal submissions and research grant applications from governmental bodies such as the AHRC and ESRC. We maintain that it is not transphobic to investigate and analyse this area from a range of critical academic perspectives. We think this research is sorely needed, and urge the government to take the lead in protecting any such research from ideologically driven attack.

Poland asked the U.S. to hand over Karkoc for trial last July. It was not immediately clear when Karkoc would be examined to determine his fitness to traval. Karkoc's family denies that he was involved in any war crimes. On Thursday, his son, Andriy Karkoc, issued a statement saying: 'My father was, is and remains innocent. We look forward to his complete exoneration.' Prosecutors from Poland's National Remembrance Institute claim that evidence shows that American Michael K.  whose last name they haven't released in line with Poland's privacy laws  was a commander of a unit in the SS-led Ukrainian Self Defense Legion that raided eastern Poland's village of Chlaniow in July 1944, killing 44 people, including women and children. The investigation was opened after The AP published a series of stories establishing that Karkoc commanded the unit, based on wartime documents, testimony from other members of the unit and Karkoc's own Ukrainian-language memoir. The AP also established that Karkoc lied to American immigration officials to get into the United States several years after the war. German prosecutors also opened an investigation into Karkoc after The AP's 2013 stories. In 2015, they concluded there was enough evidence to pursue murder charges, but shelved their investigation, deciding Karkoc was unfit to stand trial based upon medical reports from his own doctors. Andriy Karkoc reiterated that Thursday, saying his family provided copies of his father's physical and mental health records to the German government in 2015, and the Germans suspended their investigation based on those records. He said the records were also provided to the director of the U.S. Department of Justice Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section.

The piece also notes that Trump has given good advice when issuing hurricane warnings via his Twitter feed before it launched an attack on the president. When it comes to extreme weather, Mr. Trump is complicit. He plays down humans role in increasing the risks, and he continues to dismantle efforts to address those risks. It is hard to attribute any single weather event to climate change. But there is no reasonable doubt that humans are priming the Earths systems to produce disasters, the editorial board wrote. Billionaire Jeff Bezos paper then quotes a climate researcher who said that previous hurricanes would not have produced so much rain without human-induced climate change and Florence is another indication of global warming.

Shares of the drugmaker fell as much as 15.8 pct to $38.75. The drug, SPN-812, is a non-stimulant and belongs to the same class of medicine as Eli Lilly and Cos Strattera and Shire Plcs Intuniv. Analysts on average said that SPN-812 has failed to stand out from existing treatment options for ADHD. But if Supernus is able to show that its drug takes effect quicker and causes fewer side effects than rival drugs, the company could benefit. The two placebo-controlled studies tested three doses of SPN-812 and the company said it proved effective in reducing symptoms such as hyperactivity and lack of attention in affected children aged six to 11 in both the studies. In one trial, patients showed statistically significant results as early as a week into treatment on two doses, Supernus said. The drug was shown to be safe across all doses, with a few adverse reactions such as headache, decreased appetite and fatigue. The studies reached statistical significance on their primary endpoints...but not at a level that represents a clear standout from Strattera, Stifel analyst Annabel Samimy said. The analyst also added that the drugs early onset of action was important as slow onset has been a primary complaint among other non-stimulants. The company said on a conference call that SPN-812 would be able to capture 3-5 percent of the ADHD market. Brokerage Mizuho Securities sees promising yields if the treatment gets U.S. approval. The drug could be commercially compelling despite a weaker-than-expected data, Mizuho said, estimating sales of about $600 million in 2025. Supernus has a good drug, with a good profile, in a huge market, Cowen analyst Ken Cacciatore said. Children with ADHD, a common developmental disorder, often have trouble paying attention and controlling compulsive behavior. Preliminary data from two other late-stage studies evaluating SPN-812 in adolescents are expected by end of the first quarter of 2019, the company said.","article_id":"1072517","cause_effect":{"Analysts on average said that SPN-812 has failed to stand out from existing treatment options for ADHD.":["Shares of the drugmaker fell as much as 15.8 pct to $38.75.","shares fell about 16 percent on Thursday as the data failed to convince some investors that the drug was better than rivals."],"The studies reached statistical significance on their primary endpoints...but not at a level that represents a clear standout from Strattera,":["Shares of the drugmaker fell as much as 15.8 pct to $38.75.","shares fell about 16 percent on Thursday as the data failed to convince some investors that the drug was better than rivals."]}},{"id":"131716320","title":"Keith Ellison Boycotting NFL Over 'Cowardly & Idiotic' Anthem Policy","lead":"Rep.

It was a bitterly cold night, with temperatures in the teens, and the wind chill made it feel below zero. Water leaking from fire hoses froze in streaks on the concrete, and displaced residents walked around draped in American Red Cross blankets. Three young girls were whisked into a neighboring building after climbing down a fire escape with no shoes or coats. Officials said they were opening up the nearby Grace H. Dodge vocational high school as a reception center for people who needed housing and other services. People looking for relatives who lived in the building were also told to go to the school, or to call 311.

She summoned her husband and two sons, 11 and 16, to the window, and they descended the front fire escape as smoke rose near them. Photo Later, Ms. Hernandez said in Spanish, she saw the charred bodies of two women who lived together and their two young daughters being carried away on stretchers. Through the closed windows of a building next door, the smoke seeped into a fifth-floor apartment where Ana Santiago, 25, was cooking dinner. Ms. Santiago said she called 911 and ran downstairs with her 4-year-old son, knocking on neighbors doors as she went.

The building, constructed of plaster and brick, was not fireproof. It was built in 1916 and had more than 20 units, according to property records. City records appeared to indicate that as of Thursday, the building had six open violations, including one for a defective smoke detector on the first floor. That was the floor where the fire began, Commissioner Nigro said. The 12 confirmed fatalities made the fire the deadliest since an inferno at the Happy Land social club  less than a mile from Thursdays blaze  killed 87 people in 1990. It surpassed the toll from a fire a decade ago, in March 2007, when an overheated cord to a space heater caused a fire that tore through a four-story house in the Bronx and killed 10 people, nine of them children.

Cuomo; Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president; and Rafael Salamanca Jr., the neighborhoods City Council member  took to Twitter late Thursday to offer their condolences. Mr. Cuomo said he was closely monitoring the situation. Kwabena Mensah, 62, said he had visited four hospitals looking for his son, Emmanuel Mensah, who lives on the third floor of the building. Six others who live in the apartment evacuated safely and were gathered at the elder Mr. Mensahs home nearby, he said, but his son was nowhere to be found.

We can confirm that today LAPD Detectives arrested Michael Avenatti on suspicion of domestic violence. This is an ongoing investigation and we will provide more details as they become available.  LAPD HQ (@LAPDHQ) November 15, 2018 TMZ says of the woman involved in the alleged incident, Were told her face was swollen and bruised. Our sources say the alleged incident occurred Tuesday, but there was a confrontation Wednesday between the two at an exclusive apartment building in the Century City area of L.A. Update: Lisa Storie-Avenattis attorney issued a statement denying Michael Avenattis estranged wife made the allegation, calling TMZs report inaccurate. My client and I have reviewed the TMZ article alleging that my client, Lisa Storie-Avenatti, has been injured and that Michael Avenatti has been arrested as a result of some incident that occurred between them. This article is not true as it pertains to my client, the lawyer told BuzzFeed News. Ms. Storie-Avenatti was not subject to any such incident on Tuesday night. Further, she was not at Mr. Avenattis apartment on the date that this alleged incident occurred. My client states that there has never been domestic violence in her relationship with Michael and that she has never known Michael to be physically violent toward anyone. The woman involved in the alleged physical altercation reportedly scrambled from the apartment where the incident occurred and was spotted on the sidewalk holding her hands over her eyes while shouting into her cell phone. I cant believe you did this to me, she said, according to TMZ. Five minutes later, TMZ continues, Avenatti arrived at the apartment complex and yelled repeatedly, She hit me first, then, This is bullshit, this is fucking bullshit. The alleged melee occurred after the woman attempted to pick up her belongings and called 911 after tempers ran hot. Los Angeles authorities confirmed Avenatti is currently in police custody. Avenatti rose to national prominence as the legal representative of Daniels, who has alleged she had intercourse with President Donald Trump years before entering the Oval Office. Avenatti is one of a handful of potential 2020 Democrat hopefuls crisscrossing the county in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election and was active during the midterm election. To some Democrats, he represents the nonpolitician appeal that in part led President Trump to victory over more experienced politicians in 2016. Others see someone whose brash confidence could be the ultimate weapon against the president in 2020. The people who were there appreciated him pushing back on Donald Trump, said Jaime Harrison, a former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman who visited with Avenatti during a trip to Florence. I give Avenatti an A-plus in terms of appeal because theres a section of the Democratic Party thats going to want that. While Avenatti is attempting to burnish his credentials as a potential 2020 heavyweight, the attorney is facing mounting legal entanglements, including a possible criminal investigation by the Justice Department. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has asked for a criminal investigation into whether Julie Swetnick and Avenatti conspired to provide false statements to Congress and obstructed a congressional investigation during the confirmation process for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Grassley wrote in a letter to the Justice Department that Swetnick and Avenatti made serious allegations that required significant resources to investigate. However, Grassley says information from media interviews and elsewhere indicates their statements likely contained materially false claims. I dont take lightly making a referral of this nature, but ignoring this behavior will just invite more of it in the future, Grassley said in a statement. Avenatti released a sworn statement in which Swetnick said she witnessed Kavanaugh consistently engage in excessive drinking and inappropriate contact of a sexual nature with women in the early 1980s. Kavanaugh denied the allegations and an FBI background check cleared him of any wrongdoing. Further, Avenatti was ordered last month to pay $4.85 million to an attorney who worked at his former law firm, a California judge ruled. The Los Angeles judge ordered the payout the same day a separate ruling came down evicting Eagan Avenatti LLC from its office space in Southern California after four months of unpaid rent. In the case over back pay, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Dennis Landin ruled that Avenatti personally guaranteed a settlement with attorney Jason Frank, who said Eagan Avenatti misstated its profits and that he was owed millions of dollars.

Kobach told the Kansas City Star last week that he gets paid for his columns for Breitbart, many of which have focused on immigration. Two of his columns in July focused on the work of the commission. Hes also given radio interviews on Breitbart News Daily discussing the commission. Kobachs office did not respond to multiple requests for comment on his compensation arrangement with Breitbart. Richard Painter, a former ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush White House, said Kobach could be in trouble under federal law if he gave interviews or wrote about the commissions work while also getting paid by Breitbart. If youre getting paid by somebody to write about your official duties, that seems to me a clear problem under the conflict of interest statute, he told . On July 3, Kobach wrote a column for Breitbart defending the commissions work and criticizing state officials who were rebuffing its request for state voter data. On July 19, he wrote another column defending the commission after a federal judge declined to step in to block the panel from meeting. Painter said it wouldnt be a problem if Kobach were paid to write about issues unrelated to his work on the commission, like immigration. But it could be problematic to write about the commissions work for Breitbart, even if Kobach was only negotiating compensation for future work from the outlet. Its unclear when Breitbart began paying Kobach, and a spokesman for the outlet did not return a request for comment. The White House did not respond to an inquiry asking if Kobach had disclosed his compensation with Breitbart. Kobach faces criticism as leader of the election commission because of his history of exaggerating voter fraud and pushing one of the countrys most restrictive voting measures in his state. Kansas is currently being sued by the ACLU over a law requiring residents to show proof of citizenship when they go to vote, and a federal court stepped in to block the measure in the 2016 election. An email made public as part of that litigation showed Kobach working on a draft amendment to federal voting law that would make it permissible for states to impose a proof of citizenship requirement. Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, said it could be problematic if Kobach was paid by Breitbart while also granting interviews about the commissions work. Kobachs situation with Breitbart raises some ethical questions, namely was he granting them interviews in his official capacity while on their payroll? If so, then there are potential violations that may have occurred, Libowitz wrote in an email. Painter, who is the vice chair of the CREW board, said the situation is murky but theres a case to be made that it was illegal for Kobach to get paid by Breitbart while also giving interviews about the commissions work. If he has an arrangement to get paid in the future, if he has an ongoing relationship when hes getting paid, or hes negotiating, then he shouldnt be giving them official capacity interviews, Painter said. The far-right Breitbart News, which has provided a platform for white nationalist views, has been an ally of President Donald Trumps White House. Steve Bannon, the sites chairman, ran Trumps campaign last year and served as one of Trumps top aides before resigning and returning to the site last month. Norm Eisen, a former ethics czar in the Obama White House and chair of the CREW board, said Kobachs compensation from Breitbart raised red flags. I agree that it is questionable ethically and legally for him to in effect be getting paid by Breitbart to do the work of the commission, Eisen wrote in an email. Whether this actually amounts to a violation depends upon knowing the relevant facts concerning the commission and its functioning, a matter which the Trump administration has not exactly been forthcoming about. The legal landscape is also intricate. Kobach is already facing a conflict of interest complaint over his work on the commission. In July, the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law accused him of violating the Hatch Act and using his position on the commission to bolster his campaign for Kansas governor. Regardless of whether he was doing something illegal, Kobach had a conflict of interest, said Aaron Scherb, director of legislative affairs for Common Cause, another watchdog group suing the commission. While its unclear if Kobach is doing anything illegal, he certainly has a conflict of interest serving simultaneously as a paid contributor to a news organization sitting on a federal commission while serving as an elected official and running for higher office, he wrote in an email.","article_id":"3892999","cause_effect":{"Kobach told the Kansas City Star last week that he gets paid for his columns for Breitbart,":["Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) may have run afoul of federal conflict of interest statutes by getting paid to write columns for Breitbart News while also acting in his official capacity as the vice chair of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity.","Kobach could be in trouble under federal law if he gave interviews or wrote about the commissions work while also getting paid by Breitbart."],"On July 3, Kobach wrote a column for Breitbart defending the commissions work and criticizing state officials who were rebuffing its request for state voter data.

Local authorities said a preliminary investigation concluded that the attack was targeted on Bilour and that 'a young boy blew himself up at the main entrance of the gathering when Bilour entered the venue,' Dawn newspaper reports. The newspaper reports that Bilour's father, Bashir Bilour, a senior provincial minister, was also killed by the Pakistani Taliban in a targeted suicide attack in 2012.

Reuters writes that 'The ANP is a predominantly secular, ethnic Pashtun nationalist party, which has long competed with Islamist parties for votes in Pakistan's volatile Pashtun lands, along the border with Afghanistan.' The Associated Press further notes, 'Islamic extremists grew to despise the ANP when it ruled the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, of which Peshawar is the capital, from 2008 to 2013. During that time the military waged a major offensive against militants in the Swat Valley. The militants responded by carrying out a wave of attacks ahead of the 2013 elections, killing hundreds of ANP supporters.'

However, the Home Office repeatedly refused to confirm these accounts. On Friday, the Home Office issued a statement saying: We can confirm that a 28-year-old man recently released from Harmondsworth immigration removal centre died in hospital after life support was withdrawn on Thursday September 7. The Home Office declined to confirm whether he had been released from detention before or after the incident on Sunday. When asked whether confirmation of the incident had been delayed so as not to be made public at the same time as the Panorama programme, a Home Office spokesman replied: Absolutely not. A letter was circulated to detainees at Harmondsworth on Friday by the centre manager, Paul Morrison, entitled Serious Incident  Harmondsworth. The letter states that the detainee was taken to hospital after he tried to kill himself and that some detainees tried to help him immediately after the incident. This is clearly a very sad and tragic event, Morrison wrote. According to Harmondsworth detainees, the mans mother travelled by bus from Poland to see her son before the life support machine was turned off. The detainees said the man had been granted bail two weeks before the incident, but the Home Office had failed to release him. The Home Office declined to comment on this claim. Panoramas expose of immigration centre abuse is no surprise. I saw it for myself Read more One detainee, who was a friend of the man, said: He had physical and emotional problems but didnt get the help he needed from the detention healthcare service. The day before the incident he was crying like a baby and saying about healthcare: Why dont you help me, why ignore me? Fifty-nine detainees at Harmondsworth signed a protest letter after the death saying: Its a disgrace that no one has been held accountable for such poor care. We are human beings not animals. Emma Ginn, the coordinator of Medical Justice, a charity that works to improve the healthcare of immigration detainees, said: Earlier this week we called on the Home Office to close all immigration removal centres before another detainee dies. Another detainee died last night. This death, like all the others, was avoidable as immigration detention is optional. Clients have been calling us all week, traumatised by having seen what they say was a dead body, and terrified by their treatment and the conditions in immigration detention  We call again for the immediate closure of all immigration removal centres before yet another detainee dies. Forty-one people have died in immigration detention or shortly after release since 2000. The Home Office spokeswoman said: Our thoughts are with [the mans] family at this very sad time.

Kendall Court will own a majority stake in the Indonesian company by buying preference shares, the two firms said in a joint statement on Friday. Executives from Kendall Court and MMI said Indonesias healthcare sector was growing rapidly, with hospital capacity falling far short of demand. In 2014, Indonesia - the worlds fourth most populous country with 260 million people - rolled out an ambitious five-year goal of establishing universal health coverage. There are more people getting onto the healthcare system, more people requiring medical services, more drugs are required, more hospital beds are required, Chris Chia, managing partner at Kendall Court told  in an interview. Public hospitals are all at breakneck capacity, said Chia, adding that private hospitals were working with the government to cater to public patients. MMI, part of the Selaras Group conglomerate which is focused on hospitality, healthcare and property, already operates a 218-bed hospital in Karawang, about 50 km (30 miles) east of Jakarta. The Indonesian group plans to invest about $95 million to build two more hospitals in Indonesia as part of its expansion strategy. Siloam International Hospitals Tbk PT and Mitra Keluarga Karyasehat Tbk PT are among the biggest hospital operators in Indonesia. MMI Director Benedictus Widaja said MMI will build a network of hospitals focused on cardio-vascular, neuroscience and cancer specialties. The new 70,000-square metre general hospital in Jakarta would be among the citys biggest hospitals and start operations at the end of 2019, said Widaja. New local rules allowing ASEAN investors to acquire a maximum stake of 70 percent in general hospitals in Indonesia, were encouraging investors to pump money in the industry, said Chia, a former banker, who co-founded Kendall Court in 2004. Kendall Court counts several institutional and high net worth investors among its backers and has deployed and managed over $600 million in Southeast Asia in various sectors.

The announcement to slash the number of refugees for the second straight year was made in a brief statement by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday. As 's Michelle Keleman reports, the administration's move represents the lowest ceiling in decades and comes at a time when the world is grappling with massive refugee flows. There are more than 68 million displaced people around the globe, according to the UN Refugee Agency. 'In defending the move, [Pompeo] says the refugee number should not be viewed in isolation,' Keleman said. 'This year's proposed refugee ceiling must be considered in the context of the many other forms of protection and assistance offered by the United States,' said Pompeo, insisting that the U.S. is the most generous nation in the world. Pompeo added that the U.S. also has 'a massive backlog' of asylum seekers already in the country. 'This year's refugee ceiling reflects the substantial increase in the number of individuals seeking asylum in our country, leading to a massive backlog of outstanding asylum cases and greater public expense,' Pompeo said. 'The daunting operational reality of addressing the over 800,000 individuals in pending asylum cases demands renewed focus and prioritization. The magnitude of this challenge is unequaled in any other country.' Setting an annual ceiling of 30,000 allowable refugees in fiscal year 2019 does not guarantee that all of them will enter the U.S. After all, the administration has resettled less than half of the 45,000 allowed for 2018 as the fiscal year nears its end, Keleman reports. Pompeo's announcement drew immediate criticism from groups that help re-settle refugees, such as the Lutheran Immigration and Refugees Service. 'This harmful action goes against the deep beliefs and faithful traditions of American Lutherans,' said LIRS Vice President for Programs Kay Bellor in a statement. 'We have welcomed refugees because Lutherans were once refugees, too. We are called to love our neighbor and welcome the stranger. The administration's actions are putting lives at risk when we stand ready to welcome those who seek refuge into our communities.' 'A cap of 30,000 jeopardizes the safety of future refugees, including persecuted Christians, who will no longer be able to find refuge in the U.S., nor does it reflect the actual capacity or willingness of Americans to receive and resettle refugees,' said World Relief President Scott Arbeiter in a statement. 'This decision contradicts the administration's declared commitment to helping persecuted Christian and religious minorities in dangerous and oppressive countries.'

(Photo: Bill Robles, AP) RIVERSIDE, Calif. - A California man is expected to plead guilty Thursday to providing the high-powered rifles used to kill 14 people in the San Bernardino terror attack. Enrique Marquez Jr. is due to appear in federal court in Riverside after signing a plea agreement with prosecutors. Marquez, 25, of Riverside is the only person criminally charged in the deadly December 2015 attack that also left 22 people wounded at a meeting of San Bernardino County employees. Husband-and-wife assailants Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik were killed in a gunfight with authorities later that day. Marquez is charged with providing the rifles used in the rampage and plotting mass killings with Farook several years earlier that were never carried out. Prosecutors said there is no evidence Marquez participated in the San Bernardino massacre or had advance knowledge of it. Under the plea deal, Marquez could face up to 25 years in prison. A message seeking comment was left for his attorney, Young Kim. Prosecutors said Marquez acknowledged being a straw buyer when he purchased two AR-15 rifles from a sporting goods store that were used in Farooks attack on the meeting of his work colleagues. Prosecutors have said Marquez agreed to buy the weapons because the attackers feared Farooks Middle Eastern appearance might arouse suspicion. Marquez also acknowledged plotting with Farook in 2011 and 2012 to massacre college students and gun down motorists on a gridlocked Southern California freeway, though those attacks never occurred. Marquez said he backed out of the plot after four men in the area were arrested on terrorism charges in late 2012, the FBI has said in court documents. Marquez and Farook met in 2005 after Marquez moved next door to Farooks family in Riverside, about 55 miles east of Los Angeles. Farook began educating his new friend about his Muslim faith and Marquez converted in 2007. The FBI said the two began discussing extremist views shortly thereafter. By late 2011, Marquez spent time at Farooks home reading magazines published by al-Qaida and studying radical material online, federal officials said.

The Islamic State may be on the ropes, but is certainly not defeated. In an exceedingly rare video that came to light this week, its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, shows his face and renews his call for jihad against the terrorist group's adversaries by calling for, among other efforts, a 'battle of attrition.' This is a classic insurgent strategy of bleeding a better-resourced adversary using a blend of regular and irregular forces to harass and degrade. Over time, the theory goes, the enemy becomes exhausted, frustrated, and loses the will to fight. It's 'winning by not losing' or 'the war of the flea.' George Washington employed this strategy to varying degrees; Mao Zedong and others codified it; Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap deployed it against U.S. forces in Vietnam. Today, the Taliban use it against allied forces in Afghanistan. But the Islamic State's and al-Qaida's strategy is likely doomed to fail. Why? Because the U.S. has shown itself willing to expend essentially infinite resources on warring with these terrorist groups. The Stimson Center in 2018 indicated the U.S. spent 16 percent of its discretionary budget on broadly defined counter-terrorism efforts and war-fighting  some $2.8 trillion between fiscal years 2002 and 2017. America sees this as an existential fight  a battle to the death  which strengthens its resolve to wage this battle for the foreseeable future. It's going to be a long fight. Al-Qaida and its subordinate groups  the Islamic State is the direct successor to al-Qaida's Iraq franchise  have shown remarkable capacity to rebound from devastating blows. 'Success' may ultimately be unhappily defined as keeping these groups off-balance, unable to carry out their gruesome attacks against the U.S. and its allies. As unsatisfying as this may sound, defeating an ideology requires more than bullets and bombs. Trying to bankrupt the U.S. has been a longtime strategy of al-Qaida and its terrorist franchises. Back in 2004, Osama bin Laden released a statement saying, 'We are continuing this policy in bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy.' Referring to the Soviet war in Afghanistan, he said, 'We, alongside the mujahedeen, bled Russia for 10 years until it went bankrupt and was forced to withdraw in defeat.' Al-Qaida's Yemen-based franchise called for an 'Operation Hemorrhage,' following its unsuccessful effort in 2010 to destroy a cargo plane mid-flight. In its now-defunct English-language e-zine Inspire, the group noted it cost the U.S. and its allies tens of millions to stop the plot, but the terrorist group's own expenses were minimal: 'Two Nokia phones, $150 each, two HP printers, $300 each, plus shipping, transportation and other miscellaneous expenses add up to a total bill of $4,200.' A senior al-Qaida ideologue, Abu Musab al-Suri, has argued that continuous small-scale attacks would lead to jihadist success. The Islamic State in Libya is currently waging a war of attrition against its foes in that multi-sided conflict. The North African affiliate and its allies are waging a similar conflict in Mali. Attacking civilian targets steels populations and policymakers and causes them to continue to fight against such attacks. Mass murder in Paris, Istanbul, Berlin, Barcelona, New York City, Colombo and elsewhere, and the attendant saturated media coverage, all have a clarifying effect on public opinion, and policymakers will continue to take a hard-nosed stance on Islamist terror. Every successful terrorist atrocity reminds the world that these groups are out there, that they are fundamentally unwilling to compromise and hence need to be destroyed. Across the political spectrum, American politicians agree that crushing these groups remains critical to U.S. national security. To wit: President Trump routinely brags about the '100 percent' defeat of ISIS on his watch, despite evidence to the contrary. Bernie Sanders in 2016 called the Islamic State a 'barbaric organization ... it has to be destroyed.' Sen. Elizabeth Warren in 2014 said it was America's 'No. 1 priority' to destroy the Islamic State. Former Vice President Joe Biden took that up a notch, declaring, 'We will follow them to the gates of hell!' America's public resolve remains strong in this regard. Americans view the fight with these discrete terror groups as critical  upward of 70% of Americans believe fighting terrorism is a top priority, according to the last 17 Pew surveys dating back to 2002. But it's really a specific type of terrorist group that America and Americans are willing to battle endlessly  the one that attacked us here, inside our country. Al-Qaida and its offshoots such as the Islamic State that 'inspire' people to kill here  think of the 2015 San Bernardino attack, the 2016 Pulse massacre, and the 2017 New York City truck rampage  fit this bill. The U.S. doesn't consider other formally designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations to be remotely on par with ISIS, al-Qaida or their affiliates. Does it strike with similar, sustained vengeance against Hamas, Continuity Irish Republican Army, Kahane Chai, ETA or any other groups on the foreign terrorist list? No. But those groups didn't attack within the United States. Consider an alternative history in which al-Qaida had decided not to pursue a strategy of attacking the U.S. or had merely focused on striking weaker nation-states lacking the massive capacity for a counter-strike. Or what if had limited its attacks to U.S. embassies and military targets? Without the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, would the U.S. have embarked on a military campaign to uproot the group and its Taliban hosts? Of course not. Bin Laden and his confederates would likely be living publicly and unmolested in Afghanistan today. But that is not the strategy al-Qaida pursued. This week, Baghdadi's video and its wide dissemination shows that ISIS retains some degree of its propaganda capacity, a capability for tremendous violence and a general blueprint for the future. It also shows that, despite extreme, years-long pressure placed on the group, the U.S. and allied forces have been so far unable to kill or capture its leader. Last month's attacks in Sri Lanka and the Democratic Republic of Congo show the group retains the ability to strike far from its havens in the Middle East. Meanwhile, the U.S. has just sent two of its most advanced fighter jet, the F-35A, into combat for the first time to bomb an Islamic State tunnel system in Iraq. Deploying this kind of expensive weapon to destroy a modest earthen network is exactly the type of misapplication of financial resources that the Islamic State and al-Qaida want in order to bankrupt the U.S.. But this is where the war of the terrorist flea falls short. The U.S. is willing to expend whatever resources necessary to destroy these groups. The alternative  that these organizations will gleefully spill innocent blood on our streets  is something the American public will not tolerate, and American politicians ignore at their peril. The final success at the end of this war of attrition would be seeing these adversaries crushed, their leadership either in prison or in the ground.","article_id":"52882999","cause_effect":{"Killed bin Laden":["Here's Why ISIS And Al-Qaida Will Lose Their War Of Attrition"],"Here's Why ISIS And Al-Qaida Will Lose Their War Of Attrition":["the enemy becomes exhausted, frustrated, and loses the will to fight."],"Because the U.S. has shown itself willing to expend essentially infinite resources on warring with these terrorist groups.":["the enemy becomes exhausted, frustrated, and loses the will to fight."]}},{"id":"39104343","title":"National Die-In Day: US high schoolers to protest inaction on gun control","lead":"High school senior spearheads protests planned for Washington, Orlando and beyond on anniversary of Pulse nightclub shooting","body":"American high school students are organizing a National Die-In Day on 12 June to protest continued government inaction on gun control laws. The action will take place on the second anniversary of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, and will include a die-in at noon in front of the Capitol in Washington DC and another in Orlando. The teenage organizers are hoping to spark additional die-in protests at state capitols and town halls across the country  anywhere with lethal legislative inaction, as one tweet put it. The founder of the die-in day, Amanda Fugleberg, is an 18-year-old high school senior from Orlando who previously organized a walkout to protest gun violence at her high school in March. Fugleberg said the die-in in Washington would last 12 minutes. That is about one second for each of what she says have been approximately 700 mass shootings in the US, defined by the not-for-profit Gun Violence Archive as incidents resulting in at least four wounded, since the Pulse attack. The recent mass shootings in the US all have one thing in common: misogyny | Jessica Valenti Read more It was just heartbreaking, she said of the June 2016 shooting in her hometown, which left 49 people dead and more than 50 injured. That day, you just kept hearing the number [of the dead] rising and rising and rising. It really made me realize theres a problem in our country with guns. The idea of a national die-in day is being promoted by some of the high school students who helped organize previous national protests for stricter gun control laws, including the March for our Lives organizer David Hogg, a survivor of the 14 February mass shooting in Parkland, Florida. The genesis for the latest protest highlights how Parkland students have transformed the gun debate, leveraging their vast online platforms not only to battle with powerful conservative gun rights advocates, but also to direct public attention to grassroots organizing efforts by other teenagers. Fugleberg said the idea for the protest emerged after she realized that her post-graduation vacation trip to Washington, a gift from her mother, would put her in the capital on the anniversary of the Orlando shooting. She messaged Hogg about a week ago to ask if he thought it would be a good idea to organize a die-in in Washington to mark the Orlando shooting, and he supported the idea. She has since been working with other high school and college activists she connected with online to plan protests in different cities. The Pulse attack, which was for a time the deadliest mass shooting in recent American history, did not prompt new federal gun control laws, thanks to opposition from Republican members of Congress. The lack of political reaction left Fugleberg extremely disappointed, she said. It was the same conversation we always have: it was guns ... it was mental illness, and then it goes away, she said, summarizing the polarizing arguments that commonly end up stifling meaningful debate on how to respond to such events. The Orlando shooting did prompt a dramatic sit-in by Democratic legislators on the floor of the House of Representatives, a protest that failed to overcome House Republicans refusal to even allow a vote on gun control legislation. Plans for the 12 June demonstration were in progress before the news broke last Friday of another mass shooting  this time at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas, which left 10 people dead. Several high school students from Maryland were arrested Friday after staging a small die-in in front of the House Republican leader Paul Ryans office, as a protest against continued inaction by lawmakers in preventing school shootings.","article_id":"39104343","cause_effect":{"National Die-In Day:":["protest inaction on gun control"],"protest inaction on gun control":["preventing school shootings."]}},{"id":"3979824","title":"Video Shows Virginia Cop Shoot And Wound A Fleeing Teenager","lead":"Eighteen-year-old Deontrace Ward, who is accused of burglary, says he was trying to get away.","body":"Newly released video footage from October shows a white police officer in Virginia shooting and wounding a black teen whos sprinting away from cops after allegedly committing a burglary. I was just pretty much trying to get away, showing no aggression, Deontrace Ward, 18, told The Virginian-Pilot. The dramatic video comes from a body camera worn by Portsmouth police Officer Jeremy Durocher on the afternoon of Oct. 29. Durocher, who at the time had been a cop for about six months, was responding to a call of a crime in progress. Ward first appears about 16 seconds into the video, running from the front yard of a house. The teen, who police say was armed with a .45-caliber handgun, runs diagonally across the yard, away from Durocher. The video is grainy, so its impossible to tell if Ward is holding a weapon. The teen scrambles up the side of a privacy fence as Durocher commands him to stop. WARNING: The following video is graphic and may be disturbing to some viewers. Hey! Get on the ground, Durocher says, before firing two shots in Wards direction. Seconds later, as Ward clears the fence and sprints through a neighboring yard, Durocher trains his gun on the teen and fires two more shots. Ward collapses to the ground. Two other officers arrive on the scene. One of them, who has not been identified, warns Ward not to reach for a gun. I swear to God you will regret it, the unidentified officer says. Durocher told the officers he was frightened when Ward waved a gun at him. He didnt shoot, but he had it [pointed] at me as he come out the window, the officer said. That scared me so bad, when I saw the gun waved at me. Authorities say a loaded handgun was found in Wards right pant leg. This is not shown in the video.

His trial is scheduled to begin on May 1, according to The Associated Press.

The shooting occurred around 7 p.m. local time, as officers from the U.S. Marshals Service  Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force tried to take a man into custody. When the officers approached the man, law enforcement officials said, he was getting into his car in the Frayser community in northern Memphis, Tenn. That man was Webber, according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the case. The agency says Webber was 'wanted on multiple warrants.'

In another post, Sawyer says, 'Don't judge Frayser without asking a community how it feels to mourn their youth over and over again.' 'No officers were injured' in that initial encounter, according to the TBI. But the fatal shooting touched off outrage in Frayser, a predominantly black area in northern Memphis.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. President Donald Trump's escalating trade war is supposed to be about protecting American jobs  but the uncertainty it's creating is forcing some businesses to shift production overseas and cut back on hiring. On Monday, Milwaukee-based motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson announced it would be moving the production of vehicles bound for Europe to international facilities to avoid what it estimated would be $100 million in annual tariffs. The move was in reaction to the E.U.'s raising tariffs on U.S.-produced motorcycles from 6 percent to 31 percent. The tariffs were in retaliation for Trump's levying tariffs on imported aluminum and steel. 'Harley-Davidson maintains a strong commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing, which is valued by riders globally,' the company said in a statement. 'Increasing international production to alleviate the E.U. tariff burden is not the companys preference, but represents the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the E.U. and maintain a viable business in Europe.' Unlike previous tariff arrangements, this one has had little in the way of planning. That's knocked businesses on their heels and left them wondering whether the president's tariffs are legitimate policy or merely political bluster. 'We're in a whole new world,' P. Welles Orr, an international trade adviser who worked as a trade representative under George H.W. Bush, told . 'Companies left and right are getting caught off guard,' Craig Kennison, an auto industry analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co, told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel this week. It's hard to run a business when the rules keep changing. Harley isn't the only company having to reassess its corporate model on the fly. CEOs surveyed by the influential Business Roundtable lobby said this month they've reduced their hiring plans for the year by 13 percent and trimmed their spending expectations by 4 percent. Trump escalated the trade war tensions Sunday, threatening in a tweet to hit back harder at any country that has placed tariffs on American goods, demanding they 'remove those Barriers & Tariffs or be met with more than Reciprocity by the U.S.A.' 'This administration is about shock and awe  and in trade policy that is clearly by design,' Orr said. 'To this administration that chaos is a good thing. It's got people up in arms and that's its purpose.'

Andronicos Sideras, 55, was sentenced to four-and-a-half years, while his co-conspirator, 58-year-old Ulrik Nielsen, was jailed for three-and-a-half years at Inner London crown court on Monday. A third man, 44-year-old Alex Beech, was given a suspended sentence. The plot was not confined to this country, not confined to the firms we have heard about, and its a big issue for the public to be concerned about, but the fact is it was discovered by accident and only emerged as a problem because of your activity, the judge, Owen Davies QC, told the men as he passed sentence on Monday. Its not a mitigating factor, in my judgment, that other people were at it as well as you. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Andronicos Sideras pleaded not guilty to conspiring to defraud customers. Photograph: Isabel Infantes\/PA Sideras, of Southgate, London, was convicted at trial last week after pleading not guilty to conspiring to defraud customers by adding the horsemeat to batches of beef and relabelling them as pure beef. The conspiracy involved Nielsens Danish firm, FlexiFoods, shipping consignments of horsemeat to Siderass premises in north London, where they were mixed with beef, repackaged and relabelled as the latter. Beech was Nielsens right-hand man and worked in FlexiFoods UK office, where he arranged for the shipments to be transferred and handled the accounting. On Monday, the judge told the men: Its difficult to recall now the conditions that made this horsemeat scandal headline news every day five years ago but it made an impact on the public in general. They were suspicious of the food that they had  it extended far beyond meat. The confidence in the food chain was affected adversely, and the share prices of big supermarkets were affected, and it is difficult to recreate the feeling of anxiety that the public had at the time this all emerged. It was not an activity that was brought to an end by anything other than the arrest of the perpetrators. The victims in question, properly so-called, of conspiracy to defraud were customers, either wholesalers or the customers of the markets and supermarkets who bought an item that was not what it said it was. The prosecutor, Jonathan Polnay, described the conspiracy as a simple process during Siderass trial. In 2012, beef sold for around 3 [GBP2.60] a kilogram at wholesale prices. Horsemeat was cheaper. At the time, it sold for around 2 [GBP1.75] a kilogram. The money was made by selling the mix as 100% beef. The majority of the meat, including some from farm horses not sold for slaughter, made it into the food chain and, while the face value of the fraud was GBP177,869, police said the true cost had probably run into millions of pounds. Sideras, the boss of Dinos & Sons, claimed he was only holding perfectly legal loads of horsemeat for his business contacts and said he had only relabelled some of it because the pallets had been damaged in transit and needed to be restacked. He was arrested in July 2013 after his fingerprints were found on suspect labels attached to a shipment of what investigators found to be a mix of about 30% horsemeat and 70% beef in Northern Ireland. The load also contained microchips for one Irish and two Polish horses that had previously been owned as pets or riding horses. Their original owners had not been aware that they had been sold on for slaughter. Each of the men was convicted of a single count of conspiracy to defraud between 1 January and 30 November 2012.","article_id":"39159054","cause_effect":{"greed-motivated plot to pass off 30 tonnes of horsemeat as beef":["Two men jailed"]}},{"id":"4374398","title":"Chicago police teaming up with feds once more to fight shocking rise in violent carjackings","lead":"Chicago cops are calling in the feds--again--to help combat violent carjackings.","body":"Chicago cops are calling in the fedsagain--to help combat violent carjackings.

It wasn't specified what the future pontiff wanted to explore. The revelation came in a dozen conversations Francis had with French sociologist Dominique Wolton, writing a soon-to-be-published book. La Stampa, an Italian daily, quoting from some of the conversations on Friday, said Francis went to the analyst's home. Francis was quoted as saying: 'one day, when she was about to die, she called me. Not to receive the sacraments, since she was Jewish, but for a spiritual dialogue.' 'She was a good person. For six months she helped me a lot,' Francis said.

In the conversations with the French author, Francis speaks highly of the positive influence women have had on his life. 'Those whom I known helped me a lot when I needed to consult with them,' Francis is quoted his saying. The 81-year-old pope also speaks of his state of mind now. 'I feel free. Sure, I'm in a cage here at the Vatican, but not spiritually. Nothing makes me afraid.' What bothers him, he ventured, are people with straitjacket point-of-views. He singled out 'rigid priests, who are afraid to communicate. It's a form of fundamentalism. Whenever I run into a rigid person, especially if young, I tell myself that he's sick.' But Francis concludes that 'in reality, they are persons looking for security.' In past remarks, the pope has indicated he struggled with how to use authority in his first roles of leadership as a Jesuit. The Catholic Church used to project a sense of mistrust regarding psychoanalysis. But over time, the diffidence seems diminished. Updated Vatican guidelines for use on seminaries in training future priests describe psychologists as valuable in assessing the psychological health of candidates.","article_id":"55213741","cause_effect":{"'one day, when she was about to die, she called me.":["Francis speaks highly of the positive influence women have had on his life."]}},{"id":"18539304","title":"Georgia protests: Thousands storm parliament over Russian MP","lead":"Protesters have attempted to storm Georgias parliament over the appearance of a Russian MP.","body":"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Policemen detain a man during a protest against the visit of the Russian delegation in Tbilisi Protesters have attempted to storm Georgia's parliament as thousands held a mass rally against the appearance of a Russian lawmaker.

It forecast 1.2 percent growth last November. In 2020, the Italian economy was likely to expand by 0.8 percent, helped by a positive carry-over effect and two more working days, the Commission said. It had forecast 1.3 percent growth in November. The forecasts depressed the FTSE Italia all-share index .FTITLMS and Italian borrowing costs rose as 10-year bond yields increased 10 basis points to a one-month high of 2.942 percent IT10YT=RR. The Italy-Germany 10-year yield spread rose 14 bps DE10IT10=RR to its widest in two months. Italys GDP contracted 0.1 percent in the third quarter and 0.2 percent in the last three months of 2018, putting the economy into a technical recession for the first time in five years. The recent slackening of economic activity is more attributable to ... uncertainty related to the governments policy stance and rising financing costs took its toll, the Commission said. Italys borrowing costs surged in the second half of 2018 as investors grew worried that the populist government in Rome wanted to borrow more to finance generous welfare and pension policies, even though Italy already has the second-highest public debt in Europe at 132 percent of GDP. ITALY NEEDS RESPONSIBLE POLICIES What Italy needs is deep structural reforms and decisive action to bring down high levels of public debt, in other words, responsible policies that support stability, confidence and investment, Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said. The Commission forecast Italian quarterly growth would be zero in the first three months of 2019 and just 0.1 percent in the second quarter against the previous three months. Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria played down the economic difficulties, saying growth had stalled but it was wrong to say the country was in a recession. For now, we can talk about a setback rather than a real recession, Tria told parliament. But he added that indicators showed that Italy was facing growing difficulty in maintaining previous output levels. The weak economic performance raises questions over whether Italy can deliver the planned budget deficit of 2.04 percent of GDP this year  a hard-won compromise agreed with the Commission last year. The Commission had wanted to put Italy into an EU disciplinary procedure, which could mean fines, over Romes plan to increase the budget deficit to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2019 through tax cuts and spending on welfare and earlier pensions. In the end, Italy avoided the disciplinary steps by cutting the target to 2.04 percent, but that assumed economic growth would be 1.0 percent. Tria said that the government had no plans to adopt corrective measures to rein in the budget deficit.","article_id":"1353046","cause_effect":{"uncertainty over government policies":["The European Commission slashed its forecasts for Italy's economic growth in 2019 and 2020"],"higher borrowing costs":["The European Commission slashed its forecasts for Italy's economic growth in 2019 and 2020"]}},{"id":"4952432","title":"Somalia explosion: At least 75 people killed in Mogadishu","lead":"At least 75 people are dead after a car bomb rocked the Somali capital of Mogadishu, medical officials said Sunday.","body":"Mogadishu, Somalia () At least 75 people are dead after a car bomb rocked the Somali capital of Mogadishu, medical officials said Sunday.

The Masjid Al Rahma said in a statement on its Facebook page Thursday that it would not be hosting its planned Eid al-Adha prayer Friday morning at the Comfort Inn in Revere, Massachusetts  or any more Friday prayers there going forward. Mosque officials maintained that an anonymous caller had complained to the hotel numerous times. Crystal Keshawarz, a Los Angeles, California, community organizer, says she was among several women who called. Fabiola Sandoval, an events manager at the facility, confirmed the hotel canceled Friday's event and all future ones at the site, but said the company wasn't commenting further. Mosque officials, who did not respond to requests for comment, said on Facebook earlier this week that they were restricting admission to men only because the venue was too small to accommodate women and children. Reaction on social media was strongly opposed to the move. Commenters on the mosque's Facebook page argued the policy ran counter to the spirit of the holy day, which marks the end of hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, as well as commemorating the willingness of the prophet Ibrahim (Abraham in the Jewish and Christian tradition) to sacrifice his son as God had commanded. They argued that Eid al-Adha is a day of religious observance for the entire Muslim community, not just men. Many questioned why the mosque hadn't simply made the event open to first arrivals or secured another venue. 'We are all worshippers and deserve a place to observe the blessed day of Eid,' Paulette Haddi, a resident of nearby Chelsea, Massachusetts, said in a Facebook post. Malika MacDonald, a Boston-based director at the nonprofit Islamic Circle of North America Relief, said many mosques hold services in parks, parking lots or other outdoor venues to accommodate large crowds. The debate is emblematic of the broader problem of 'inferior arrangements' for women in Islamic prayer spaces that can sometimes include cramped quarters and separate entrances, said Zahra Khan, an MIT-educated aerospace engineer in Pasadena, California. Mosque organizers, on their Facebook page, dismissed the criticism as 'negativity' from people trying to divide their community. They said they were giving members fair notice so they can plan to attend other nearby services, if needed.","article_id":"115917074","cause_effect":{"exclusion complaints":["Mosque's men only prayer canceled"]}},{"id":"4868235","title":"Kabul bombing: Death toll jumps to 150 one week after attack","lead":"The death toll from one of Afghanistan's worst terrorist attacks in years has risen to at least 150, President Ashraf Ghani told reporters Tuesday.","body":"Photos: A suicide bomb attack targets Kabul's diplomatic zone Afghan security forces patrol the site of a deadly suicide bomb attack in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Wednesday, May 31.

Police are investigating the shooting death of the 29-year-old. (Photo: McKee family, AP) LONDON  Police in Northern Ireland on Saturday arrested two teenagers in connection with the fatal shooting of a journalist during rioting in the city of Londonderry. The men, aged 18 and 19, were detained under anti-terrorism legislation and taken to Belfast for questioning, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said. The men have not been identified or charged. Police had said earlier there was one gunman who pulled the trigger who had been backed by an organization, and said they were searching for multiple suspects. Lyra McKee, 29, a rising star of investigative journalism, was shot and killed, probably by a stray bullet aimed at police, during rioting Thursday night. Police said the New IRA dissident group was most likely responsible and called it a terrorist act. The use of a firearm apparently aimed at police marks a dangerous escalation in sporadic violence that continues to plague Northern Ireland 21 years after the Good Friday peace agreement was signed. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton said earlier that a gunman fired a number of shots at police during the unrest. Police on Friday night released closed-circuit TV footage showing the man suspected of firing the shots that killed McKee. Police appealed for help from the community, stating that people knew the shooter and should help police identify him. The rioting started after police moved into the Creggan housing complex to search for weapons. The killing was condemned by all the major political parties as well as the prime ministers of Britain and Ireland. Speaking in Dublin, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland had chosen peace and cooperation on Good Friday 21 years ago and will not be dragged into the past by political violence. The victim was mourned by friends, those who had read her work, and by the wider community. She rose to prominence in 2014 with a moving blog post  Letter to my 14 year old self  describing the struggle of growing up gay in Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland.

(Photo: Charles McQuillan, Getty Images) In the post, she described the shame she felt at 14 as she kept the secret of being gay from her family and friends, and the love she eventually received when she was finally able to reveal it. She also had recently signed a contract to write two books. Hours before her death, she tweeted a photo of the rioting with the words: Derry tonight. Absolute madness. Her partner, Sara Canning, told a vigil Friday that McKees amazing potential had been snuffed out. Canning said the senseless murder has left me without the love of my life, the woman I was planning to grow old with. It has left so many friends without their confidante, she added. The shooting reveals how difficult it is to snuff out the last bit of violent resistance to the peace agreement. The New IRA is a small group who reject the 1998 Good Friday agreement that marked the Irish Republican Armys embrace of a political solution to the long-running violence known as The Troubles that claimed more than 3,700 lives. The group is also blamed for a Londonderry car bombing that did not cause any injuries in January. It is regarded as the largest of the splinter dissident groups still operating and has been linked to several other killings in the past decade.

The president of the Blue Knot Foundation, Cathy Kezelman, said demand for the childhood trauma service spiked when a suppression order lifted on 26 February, revealing Pell was guilty of five charges, including sexually penetrating a 13-year-old choirboy. Its been so challenging, as weve had double the normal amount of calls since then, Kezelman said. Some people are acutely distressed. The story is playing out in public in such a way that its impossible, almost, to avoid it. A significant amount of the reporting defended the cardinal and attempted to discredit the victims abuse. Cardinal George Pell's conviction: the questions that remain Read more People have their own personal relationship with Cardinal Pell, but I dont know how people can connect their friendship with someone as to whether they are innocent or not, Kezelman said. Australias child sexual abuse royal commission found many child abusers were intelligent, liked and respected. It also found survivors took, on average, 23.9 years to tell someone about their abuse, and men often took longer to disclose than women. Some victims never disclose. Pells complainant disclosed as an adult, about 18 years after the attacks. Kezelman said despite the commissions work, a lot of myths had been spread about abusers and victims by the media in discrediting Pells conviction. She urged those struggling to seek professional help. People are feeling very triggered and are in need of being held and feeling safe, Kezelman said. They should know [that] any reaction is valid and all these things are normal in the context of very public trauma stories playing out, especially when what is playing out is the victims struggle, despite a trial, to be believed. Assoc Prof Tim Moore is the deputy director of the Australian Centre for Child Protection at the University of South Australia. He said he was concerned about the messages some of media reporting of Pells trial were sending to young people who were being abused now. We need the public to realise kids are still at risk and being abused, and we need to give kids enough information to come to an adult, Moore said. My fear with some of the public discourse is that kids experiencing abuse are being told its not OK to share their experience, that they wont be believed. We need to empower them, and ensure they are safe. But instead the message from some seems to be: even if you come forward and go through a gruelling experience like attending court, the public is still not always going to give you the support you deserve. Judy Courtins law firm represents victims of child sexual abuse. She said she had been inundated by phone calls and emails from her clients, whom she described as incredibly distressed. She said this trauma was a direct result of the commentary in support of Pell. The inconsistencies of George Pell's defenders just display their power | Richard Cooke Read more Some of the commentators arent being very intelligent and all theyre showing is how little they know and understand about how child sex crimes are committed and the impact, Courtin said. I think theyre displaying an absolute arrogance. And they have opened up wounds, big time. One of her clients had since attempted suicide, she said. Where was the church for this man last week? she said. Where is the church for this man now? Instead of helping this man, they treat him as the enemy and fight him to the death  almost literally. Such high-profile figures supporting Pell, saying hes still innocent, is terribly harmful. Its saying to people like this young man, what you say is not worth a thing. Chrissie Foster, whose daughters Emma and Katie suffered sexual abuse at the hands of a priest over several years, was angered by the level of criticism of Pells trial from people who were not there or who could not have read transcripts. In 1998 one of her daughters received a letter signed by Pell apologising for the abuse she had suffered. But a separate letter from the churchs compensation scheme, established by Pell, said the $50,000 in compensation offered to her should provide an alternative to litigation that will otherwise be strenuously defended. Foster remains a tireless advocate for victims, and was present during Pells trial in November and December. She had a message for survivors struggling amid the support for Pell. Dont let the Catholic church or the priesthood take any more of your life than they already have, she said.

Daily Record) YORK, Pa.  A woman who reported that she had been sexually abused by a Catholic priest in Pennsylvania when she was a teenager, is now suing the Catholic Church after finding out the church investigated her and her family. Juliann Bortz, now 68, had become a member of a survivors' group and an outspoken critic of the church and its efforts to conceal the abuse perpetrated by its clergy. It wasnt until the Pennsylvania grand jury report on sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests came out that the woman realized the lengths the church would go to protect itself. The report identified more than 300 priests who preyed on more than 1,000 children in six Roman Catholic dioceses across the state. According to the grand jury, the church investigated her and her family, looking for information, however irrelevant to her accusations, that would serve to discredit her. The church hired investigators to dig into her life, looking for dirt that the church apparently hoped would cast doubt on her accusations, despite her testimony being bolstered by another woman who witnessed her abuse and endured abuse herself. Aug. 26: When she reported being abused by a priest, the Catholic Church investigated her Aug. 14: 'Men of God hid it all': Church protected more than 300 'predator priests' in Pa., grand jury says Bortz, from the Allentown, Pennsylvania, area was shocked. The church suggested that she was cooperating with authorities because her daughter had witnessed a murder and that she was somehow seeking favor with prosecutors on behalf of her daughter, even though her daughter was merely a witness and had never been suspected of anything. The churchs investigation, according to the grand jury, even suggested that there was something suspicious about her husbands involvement in a Christian motorcycle club. The churchs investigators suspected that she was looking for her 15 minutes of fame, according to the grand jury. That was all news to Bortz. It made her angry, she said in an interview a few weeks ago, just days after appearing on the dais when Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro announced the findings of the grand jury. Its crazy, she said at the time. Its absolutely crazy. On Wednesday, Bortz fired back, filing a lawsuit in Lehigh County (Pennsylvania) Court charging the church with defamation for the smear campaign the church waged against her when she chose to speak out about the abuse she endured and her advocacy for other victims. Her lawyer, Ben Andreozzi, described the litigation as unique, perhaps the first attempt to sue the church for its egregious behavior in trying to silence victims. Aug. 30: Will more states follow Pennsylvania's lead and investigate priest sexual abuse? Here's what they say Aug. 22: One priest was arrested for soliciting sex, but his diocese just moved him again Its the first attempt to hold the church accountable for this type of behavior, Andreozzi said, that the church tried to turn up dirt on her and her family rather than focusing on the offender. With regard to the allegations in this lawsuit, the Diocese did not disclose the information publicly. We provided it to the Grand Jury as a result of a subpoena. In fact, it was the Grand Jury Report that made this information public. Statement from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Allentown, Pennsylvania The suit accuses the church of inflicting emotional distress and defaming Bortz by attempting to gather irrelevant, unrelated (or) false dirt  on her and her family. According to the grand jury report, Father Francis Fromholzer sexually abused Bortz when she was a 14-year-old freshman at Allentown Central Catholic High School. She and another girl, who was not named in the grand jury report, had been abused by the priest during a trip to the Poconos. Fromholzer, who retired in October 2002, has denied the allegations. Attempts by the girls to report the abuse were met by rebukes from the church. But it wasnt until the grand jury report was released that Bortz learned the extent of the churchs efforts to discredit her. As Juliann first learned in August 2018, instead of taking Juliann seriously, and investigating Fromholzers abuse of children, the suit states, the diocese immediately attempted to undermine and discredit Juliann and her family.  Bortz, the suit alleges, was beyond devastated, felt betrayed and suffered severe psychological\/psychiatric distress when she learned of the lengths the church went to discredit her. The Dioceses handling of Juliann Bortz allegations of sexual abuse against Fromholzer were indicative of how Pennsylvanias Catholic Dioceses, including Allentown, silenced victims, protected child abusers and avoided scandal, the suit states. Diocese responds In a statement released in response to the lawsuit, the Allentown Diocese said, 'Bishop (Alfred) Schlert has always viewed victims as sincere, dignified, and extremely courageous for coming forward. He has always treated them with respect, and always will. For those who suggest otherwise, nothing could be further from the truth. It's the first attempt to hold the church accountable for this type of behavior. Ben Andreozzi, attorney for Juliann Bortz 'With regard to the allegations in this lawsuit, the Diocese did not disclose the information publicly. We provided it to the Grand Jury as a result of a subpoena. In fact, it was the Grand Jury Report that made this information public. 'The Diocese did not solicit this information. The Diocese never investigated the victim or attempted to discredit her. The Diocese never acted on the unsolicited information. In fact, after the Diocese met with the victim in 2002, the Diocese removed the priest from ministry. Law enforcement already was aware of the allegation. 'As a Diocese, we treat victims with compassion, respect and dignity. We would never direct anyone to do otherwise.' She wants an apology In addition to unspecified monetary compensation, the lawsuit specifically seeks an apology from the church and a private meeting to allow church officials to explain how this happened and what steps they have taken to ensure this never happens again. Her lawyer said, It isnt about the money. Juliann wants an apology, and she wants answers about whose idea it was to smear her name. Andreozzi said Bortz also hopes that the litigation sheds light on the churchs efforts to intimidate and discredit other victims by turning up dirt on victims and their family members rather than the offenders. Bortz had previously reported the abuse to law enforcement, which referred the case to the Lehigh County district attorney, who declined to prosecute, citing the expiration of the statute of limitations. A previous lawsuit filed by Bortz against the church also had been dismissed for the same reason. Follow Mike Argento on Twitter: @FnMikeArgento Aug. 22: The Catholic church covered up abuse.

He told a Minneapolis television state that Damond's family in Australia is in disbelief. 'She obviously was not armed, she was not a threat to anyone, nor could she have reasonably been perceived to be,' he told WCCO-TV. Bennett strongly disputed the suggestion from an attorney for Noor's partner that the two officers might reasonably have feared an ambush. 'I think that is ludicrous, that is disinformation,' Bennett said. 'It doesn't have any basis in fact.' Noor, who has been with the department almost two years, cannot be forced to talk to the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. He will have to give a statement as part of his department's internal investigation.

Stephen Govel Photography When it comes to talking to authorities, defense attorneys and legal experts said police officers have the same constitutional right against self-incrimination as everyone else. 'Any lawyer that would recommend to him that he should give a statement to the BCA should be disbarred,' said Joe Friedberg, a Minneapolis defense attorney who's not involved in the case. 'Nobody should ever speak to law enforcement when they're the subject of a criminal investigation.' In contrast, Officer Jeronimo Yanez in the nearby suburb of St. Anthony sat down with state agents last summer the day after he shot Castile. Prosecutors used his statement as evidence against him during his manslaughter trial, but the defense used it, too. Jurors apparently accepted Yanez's claims that he saw Castile's gun and believed his life was in danger. Yanez was acquitted. The Minneapolis Police Department's internal affairs unit can compel Noor to give a statement as part of its investigation, and fire him if he refuses, but that statement cannot be used against him in any criminal investigation, Friedberg said.

That is lower than the headline cost of multiplying the number of undergraduates by the GBP9,000-a-year tuition fees because the policy only applies to English students, and young people from households earning less than GBP25,000 a year are exempt. Until recently they also received top-up grants, which are now top-up loans. The devolved parliament in Edinburgh and the Welsh assembly have their own education budgets and have developed different ways of funding higher education. University officials agree that GBP10bn would pay for both policies. The figure breaks down into around GBP8bn to replace fees for students in England and GBP2bn to bring back maintenance grants. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, has not ruled out Labour making good on the pledge  although Labour has yet to spell out how it would be funded. It is unlikely that it could be paid for by raising corporation tax to 26%, since much of that revenue is already earmarked, including GBP8bn for schools, educational maintenance grants and free school meals for all primary school pupils. That increase to 26%, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, could bring in GBP19bn, but that total is likely to decline as firms relocate to lower tax locations and invest less  meaning lower growth. Critics of the proposal to scrap tuition fees argue that the biggest winners would be middle and higher income families who currently pay the most under what is a means-tested scheme. Tuition fees have been deemed necessary by governments of both left and right in order to pay for the increase in student numbers. In 1960, only 5% of young people entered higher education; today the figure is about 40%, with around 400,000 new English undergraduates each year. The Labour leader said last year that his plan contrasted with a Tory move to allow approved universities to increase their tuition fees, which he said was a tax on learning.","article_id":"39117603","cause_effect":{"over half a million young people enter higher education in the UK each year,":["Jeremy Corbyn would have to find a substantial sum of money  about GBP10bn a year"],"Jeremy Corbyn would have to find a substantial sum of money  about GBP10bn a year":["total is likely to decline as firms relocate to lower tax locations and invest less  meaning lower growth."]}},{"id":"38948931","title":"Parents of US student Otto Warmbier sue North Korea over his death","lead":"Parents of 22-year-old, returned to US in a coma after being held in North Korea, say he was brutally tortured and murdered","body":"Parents of 22-year-old, returned to US in a coma after being held in North Korea, say he was brutally tortured and murdered The parents of the US college student Otto Warmbier have sued North Korea over their sons death in 2017 following his release from captivity there, according to the lawsuit, which said their son was brutally tortured and murdered. The wrongful-death suit was filed in US district court at a diplomatically delicate time, just weeks ahead of an expected meeting between the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and Donald Trump. Kim and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, also are set to meet on Friday. Korean summit: everything you need to know Read more Otto was taken hostage, kept as a prisoner for political purposes, used as a pawn and singled out for exceptionally harsh and brutal treatment by Kim Jong-un, his father, Fred Warmbier, said in a statement. Warmbier, from Wyoming, Ohio, died at age 22 after being imprisoned in North Korea from January 2016 until he was returned to the United States in a coma. He died a few days later, and an Ohio coroner said the cause was lack of oxygen and blood to the brain. North Korea blamed botulism and ingestion of a sleeping pill and dismissed torture claims. The coroner who examined Warmbier said he had found no sign of botulism. The suit by Fred Warmbier and his wife, Cindy, seeks unspecified damages. North Korea, which is a rogue regime, took Otto hostage for its own wrongful ends and brutally tortured and murdered him, the lawsuit said. North Korea does not have an embassy in the United States. A representative of the North Korean mission to the UN in New York was not immediately available to comment. Otto Warmbier, a student at the University of Virginia, was part of a travel group. When the group tried to leave North Korea after five days, he was held at the airport. The filing says Warmbier was forced to make a false statement, confessing to invented charges that he was acting as a spy connected to the Central Intelligence Agency. US Senate confirms CIA director Mike Pompeo as Trump's secretary of state Read more Stewart Baker, a former assistant secretary of homeland security, said North Korea had immunity from lawsuits as a sovereign nation but still might be sued because of its US designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. But its almost impossible to collect any judgment that might be awarded. So its doubtful North Korea will feel sufficiently threatened by the lawsuit to upset the talks. And after all, he [Kim] can settle claims against North Korea in any US-North Korea agreement, Baker said by email. Kim is set to cross the heavily militarized border on Friday for the first summit with South Korea, setting the stage for him to meet with Trump in late May or early June. Just months ago, Trump and Kim traded threats and insults during North Koreas rapid advances in pursuit of nuclear-armed missiles capable of hitting the US. But this month it emerged that the CIA director, Mike Pompeo, had a secret meeting with the North Korean leader as part of an effort to lay the groundwork for direct talks between Trump and Kim. On Thursday, the US Senate confirmed Pompeo to be secretary of state, and the White House released two photographs of him shaking hands with Kim.","article_id":"38948931","cause_effect":{"Parents of 22-year-old, returned to US in a coma after being held in North Korea,":["wrongful-death suit was filed in US district court"],"wrongful-death suit was filed in US district court":["North Korea blamed botulism and ingestion of a sleeping pill and dismissed torture claims."],"North Korea blamed botulism and ingestion of a sleeping pill and dismissed torture claims.":["coroner who examined Warmbier said he had found no sign of botulism."]}},{"id":"115917140","title":"Devastated family of unarmed black teen shot dead doesn't 'want him to have died in vain': Attorney","lead":"Antwon Rose, 17, was shot and killed by police Tuesday night.","body":"The family of an unarmed teenager shot and killed by police while he was fleeing a traffic stop doesn't 'want him to have died in vain,' a family attorney said. Antwon Rose, 17, who was African-American, was shot dead by an East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, police officer Tuesday after the teen and two others were pulled over in a car believed to have been connected to an earlier shooting that night. The deadly shooting was caught on cell phone video, which is being reviewed by authorities. Rose's family is 'devastated' and 'stunned,' family attorney Fred Rabner told  Thursday morning. Antwon Rose\/Facebook Rabner described Rose as a 'beautiful, kind' and hard-working teenager who worked with young children at a gymnastics gym as well as at a local Domino's Pizza. 'This is not someone who was in trouble ever,' Rabner said. 'This is not a family that was anything but doting and loving about their son.' 'It doesn't seem to me that there is any justification ever for shooting an individual who is fleeing in the back,' Rabner said, adding that the officer was standing 'poised' and appear to shoot from 15 to 30 feet away.

The victim also returned fire at the passing car, police said. 'Witnesses described the vehicle involved in the shooting, and the description was broadcast' to officers, police said.  An East Pittsburgh police officer spotted a car matching the description -- a silver Chevy Cruze -- and pulled the car over at 8:40 p.m., police said. The driver was ordered out of the car and directed to the ground, police said, but Rose and another individual in that car fled on foot, police said. The officer shot three times at Rose as he fled and struck him three times, police said. The other passenger, who has not been identified, remains at large, police said. WTAE The officer had been sworn in with the department hours before the shooting, ABC station WTAE reported. He has been placed on administrative leave, police said. Rose did not have a weapon on him and none of the three suspects fired at officers, police said, adding that 'two firearms were later recovered from the suspect vehicle.'

The US Navy will be trying to figure out whether this spurt of warship accidents are singular incidents or reflect a 'systemic' problem that needs to be fixed, retired Rear Adm. John Kirby,  military and diplomatic analyst, told 's 'New Day.' 'That will certainly be I think accelerated in the wake of what happened here to the McCain. They will take a harder look. There's absolutely no question that they will want to make sure that they don't have some larger issue going on culturally or procedurally inside the Navy.' The following are the details of the four accidents: USS John S. McCain The Navy's 7th Fleet said the USS John S. McCain collided with the merchant vessel Alnic MC while the destroyer was making its way to a port in Singapore. The collision was reported at 5:24 am local time, east of the Malacca Strait, one of the world's most congested shipping routes. Ten US soldiers are missing. Significant hull damage occurred on the McCain, with flooding in berthing compartments as well as machinery and communication rooms. 'There's probably a thousand different ways how something like this can happen,' Kirby told 'New Day.' 'I know it sounds a little strange for me to say that, but it's unusual for ships to collide, although I know we have had several here in recent months.' In addition to the missing sailors, the Navy said five were injured in the collision. Four of those were flown to a hospital in Singapore with injuries that were not considered life-threatening, the Navy said. USS Fitzgerald The USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship off the coast of Japan in June, resulting in the deaths of seven US sailors. The Fitzgerald will be transported to the United States for repairs. The bow of the cargo ship directly struck the commander's cabin, according to the Navy's report detailing the immediate aftermath of the collision. The commanding officer, executive officer and senior noncommissioned officer of the USS Fitzgerald have been removed from their duties for cause A Navy report on the immediate aftermath provides a harrowing account of US sailors attempting to escape a rapidly flooding sleeping area that filled with water within minutes after the cargo ship's bow tore a hole in the side of the Fitzgerald. Of the 35 sailors in the sleeping area at the time of the collision, 28 were able to escape, but the remaining seven sailors died. USS Champlain In May, a South Korean fishing boat struck the USS Lake Champlain, while the Navy warship was conducting operations in international waters near the Korean Peninsula, the Navy said. No injuries were reported. The 60- to 70-foot-long fishing vessel collided with the Lake Champlain -- a 568-foot Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser that has been with the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson strike group. The fishing vessel crew later said it didn't have a radio and didn't hear the radio calls from the Navy, according to a Navy official. USS Antietam In late January, the guided-missile cruiser USS Antietam ran aground while trying to anchor in Tokyo Bay. The ship damaged its propellers and spilled hydraulic oil into the water off the coast of Japan. The incident did not result in any injuries to US or Japanese personnel, but the discharge of up to 1,100 gallons of hydraulic oil prompted environmental concerns.","article_id":"4804029","cause_effect":{"Navy warship accident in Asian waters took place early Monday,":["Significant hull damage occurred on the McCain, with flooding in berthing compartments as well as machinery and communication rooms."],"Significant hull damage occurred on the McCain, with flooding in berthing compartments as well as machinery and communication rooms.":["discharge of up to 1,100 gallons of hydraulic oil prompted environmental concerns."],"discharge of up to 1,100 gallons of hydraulic oil prompted environmental concerns.":["US Navy will be trying to figure out whether this spurt of warship accidents are singular incidents or reflect a 'systemic' problem that needs to be fixed,"]}},{"id":"4289084","title":"Iowa State Faculty Candidates Required to Sign 'Diversity and Inclusion' Pledge","lead":"Faculty candidates at Iowa State University are required to pledge they will demonstrate their contribution to diversity and inclusion if hired.","body":"Faculty candidates at Iowa State University are required to pledge they will demonstrate their contribution to diversity and inclusion if hired.

Rather, Democrats have begun to fall head over heels in love with the goal of defeating Donald Trump and his agenda. And to achieve that, it seems more and more Democrats may be willing to check progressive purity at the door in favor of progressive pragmatism. How far the party has shifted in just a year. Around this time in 2017, my SiriusXM radio show hosted what felt like a nightly battle between Bernie Sanders supporters and Hillary Clinton fans fighting for the heart and soul of the Democratic party. Sanders supporters believed that the Democratic party must move to the left  or at least nominate very progressive candidates  in order to not line up with their beliefs and lead Democrats to victory in 2018 (and beyond). And to be certified pure, these liberals demanded that candidates come out strongly in favor a list of issues Sanders had championed during his 2016 run for president, issues such as healthcare for all, committing to a $15 minimum wage, rejecting PAC money and passing banking reform, to name just a handful. The sense was that these progressive perfectionists were ready to abandon the Democratic Party completely  or at least stay home during the midterm elections  if this didnt happen Flash forward to March 2018, and Im now hearing some of those very same Bernie purists say that if the candidate has a D in front of their name, they will vote for them. Even more interesting: They seem to be sincere about this new strategy, not resentful. Flash forward to March 2018, and some Bernie purists say that if the candidate has a D in front of their name, they will vote for them. Some of the fruits of this new pragmatism have already appeared. Democrat Conor Lamb, the apparent winner of March 13's special election in Pennsylvanias 18th congressional district, would never have passed the progressive purity tests being espoused a year ago. For example, Lamb didnt embrace a $15 minimum wage, saying instead it sounds high based on what Ive been told by many small-business owners in our area. He also was pro-gun and on board with natural gas fracking, a big no-no for many progressives. Lamb even ran a campaign commercial pushing back against claims by his GOP opponent Rick Saccone that he was an ally of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. I've already said on the front page of the newspaper that I don't support Nancy Pelosi, Lamb said. Despite all of that, few Democrats criticized Lamb for his more centrist stances. Even progressive groups like MoveOn.org were all in for Lamb. As MoveOn.org spokesperson Karine Jean Pierre explained on my radio show on March 11, the grassroots organization committed its full support and resources to Lamb. Why? Because, as Pierre, explained, there are over 8,000 Moveon.org members in Lambs district and they had made it overwhelmingly clear that they approved of Lamb despite some of his moderate views. Importantly, this pragmatism didnt start with Lamb. Its been slowly developing over the past year, as we saw during 2017s Virginia governor's race. The Virginia Democratic gubernatorial primary last June pitted establishment-backed Lt. Governor Ralph Northam against Bernie Sanders pick, Tom Perriello. While Northam was solidly center-left, Perriello was clearly the darling of the progressive wing of the party. Some of the fruits of this new pragmatism have already appeared. Democrat Conor Lamb would never have passed the progressive purity tests being espoused a year ago. After Perriello was defeated in the primary, there were concerns that the states more left-leaning Democrats might sit out the November election. The fears of myself and others grew when, just days before the election, Northam said that if elected he would ban so-called sanctuary cities in The Old Dominion State. But on Election Day, the Democrats were there for Northam, propelling him to a nine-point victory  well ahead of polling that showed him and his GOP rival within the margin of error on election eve. In fact, a record 41 percent of Democrats came out to the polls in this off-year election, of which Northam won 97 percent. Come 2020, Im sure there will be fierce, passionate battles about over the progressive credentials of the candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. And there should be. But for 2018, its looking more and more like Democrats think blocking Trumps agenda in Congress is more important than finding the perfect person to run in every district. Republicans have experienced firsthand the successes of falling in line. The fact that Democrats may be co-opting this strategy should concern them most of all.

I was thinking of how best to describe the joy of those children as they returned to their long-forbidden desks in that ruined city. Sitting at a restaurant with the photographer, video journalist and driver before heading back to Baghdad, I read an article on my laptop about the EU debate on plans for a neighbouring rights law which would apply to the media.

Last chance to fill in the blanks on funding journalisms future | Roy Greenslade Read more In more than 40 years of reporting, I have seen the number of reporters on the ground steadily decrease as the dangers relentlessly grow. We have become targets and our reporting missions cost more and more. Gone are the days when I could go to war in a jacket, or shirtsleeves, an ID card in my pocket, along with a photographer or a video journalist. Now you need bullet-proof vests, armoured cars, sometimes bodyguards, and insurance. Who pays? The media pays, and it is a heavy cost. Yet, even though they pay for the content and send the journalists who will risk their lives to deliver a reliable, complete, trusted and diverse news service, it is not the news organisations who reap the profits but internet platforms, which help themselves to our reporting without paying a cent. This is morally and democratically unjustifiable. So many friends have stopped reporting because their news organisations have closed or can no longer pay them. Until these journalists put away their pens and cameras, we shared the terrible fear of hiding behind a wall that trembled as intensely we did from the impact of explosions; the indescribable joy when we succeeded, when we could tell the world the truth that we had seen with our own eyes; the extraordinary meetings with warlords and the heavily armed guards who smiled as they toyed with their pistols or daggers, watching as we interviewed their bosses; the poignant sorrow when faced with dazed, trapped civilians, the women awkwardly protecting their children as bullets scraped the walls of the shelter in which they had found brief refuge. The media have endured a lot of pain for a long time before reacting to the financial drain, struggling with the consequences rather than the cause. They have laid off staff almost to the point of absurdity. Now they are demanding that their rights are respected so they can carry on reporting the news. They are simply asking that the sales revenue is shared with those who produce the content, whether they are artists or journalists. This is the meaning of neighbouring rights. We can no longer swallow the lie spread by Google and Facebook that an EU directive on such rights would threaten peoples ability to access the internet for free. Free access to the web will endure because the internet giants, which now use editorial content for free, can reimburse the media without asking consumers to pay. Difficult? Impossible? Not at all. Facebook made $16bn in profits in 2017 and Alphabet (Googles parent company) $12.7bn. They simply have to pay their dues. That is how the media will survive and the internet titans will be contributing to the diversity and freedom of the press they claim to support. Mosul six months after Isis was ousted  then and now Read more I am convinced that MEPs who have been misled by lobbying now understand that unpaid access to the internet is not at risk. At stake is the freedom of the press, because when newspapers run out of journalists, that freedom (which is supported by politicians on all sides) will be gone. Countless times I have been face-to-face with people who were blockaded, isolated and defenceless, who asked just one thing: Tell people what you have seen. Then we have a chance of being saved. Should I reply: No, do not raise your hopes. We are the last journalists. Soon there will be none left because of a lack of money? Remember that Facebook and Google employ no journalists and produce no editorial content. But they get paid for the advertising linked to content that journalists produce. Every day, journalists investigate all aspects of life so they can inform their fellow citizens. Every year, prizes are awarded to the most courageous, intrepid, talented journalists. We cannot allow this fleecing of the media of their rightful revenue to culminate in a day without prizes, for lack of candidates with the means to report on the ground. It is time to act.

The report released this month found that about 300 Catholic priests abused at least 1,000 children over the past 70 years, with claims of a systematic cover-up by senior church leaders that used similar methods unearthed in the initial clergy sex-abuse story that broke nationwide in 2002. 'The Catholic Church has a moral obligation to provide its parishioners and the public a complete and accurate accounting of all sexually inappropriate behavior involving priests in Illinois,' said Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan. She also plans to contact other Illinois dioceses and will work with state's attorneys and law enforcement to investigate them if bishops don't fully cooperate. Among the Chicago-area priests named in the recent report are the Revs. Raymond Lukac, Gregory Furjanic, Jerry Kucan and Robert Spangenberg. All four priests are dead. Lukac was a known 'problem priest' accused of abusing an 11-year-old girl in the rectory of Posen's St. Stanislaus parish in the early 1960s, the report said. Furjanic has unspecified accusations predating his 2003 arrival to Chicago to serve the Croatian Franciscan Friars. Kucan is accused of a series of abuses in Pennsylvania before he was placed in Chicago's St. Jerome parish in 1982, St. Anthony in 1986, Sacred Heart in 1994 and St. Anthony's Friary 1995. Spangenberg was accused of abusing boys in Pennsylvania after serving in the 1980s as chaplain at Chicago's St. Francis de Sale High School. Chicago Archdiocese officials said Thursday they 'look forward to discussing' misconduct policies with Madigan. 'Since 2002, the Archdiocese of Chicago has reported all abuse allegations to the proper civil authorities,' the archdiocese said in a statement.

Woman Who Tried to Self-Abort Pleads Guilty to Felony","body":"A Tennessee woman accused of trying to end her pregnancy with a coat hanger has pleaded guilty to a felony and was released after more than a year in jail. Anna Yocca, 32, pleaded guilty this week to attempted procurement of a miscarriage, according to Rutherford County Criminal Court documents. Her baby survived and state officials said the child is OK. The case was unsettling for abortion rights advocates, who fear that President-elect Donald Trump might try to follow through on campaign rhetoric about penalizing pregnant women who have abortions. Trump also said he would appoint an anti-abortion Supreme Court justice who could be open to weakening or reversing the landmark abortion case, Roe v. Wade. National Advocates for Pregnant Women, which aided Yocca in the case, called the charge 'unconstitutional and a violation of international human rights principles.' 'This plea deal should not be understood as validation of arresting and punishing pregnant women who have or try to have abortions but rather a frightening example of how the criminal law system can be used to bully and punish pregnant women and mothers - with or without a conviction or valid law,' said Lynn Paltrow, Executive Director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women. Yocca, a Murfreesboro woman, was sentenced to one year with credit for time served, court documents state. She had been incarcerated since December 2015, and jail officials said she has been released. Police said Yocca filled a bathtub with water in September 2015 and attempted an abortion with a coat hanger. After she began bleeding, her boyfriend took her to a hospital and doctors delivered a 24-week-old, 1.5-pound baby. At the time, doctors said the child would need medical support the rest of his life because of his injuries. The baby was put into state custody shortly after his birth. He is no longer in custody of the state Department of Children's Services, but the child is safe, said agency spokesman Rob Johnson. Tennessee has several stringent abortion restrictions, including a 2015 law requiring women seeking abortions to receive mandatory counseling and wait 48 hours before they can get the abortion. That law faces a court challenge. There are seven abortion providers in Tennessee, said Planned Parenthood of Middle & East Tennessee Executive Director Jeff Teague.

Asked in an English-language television interview about criticism of Israeli policies by some U.S. Jews, Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely questioned whether people that never send their children to fight for their country could understand the complexity of the Middle east. Most of the Jews dont have children serving as soldiers, going to the Marines, going to Afghanistan or to Iraq, she said on i24 TV news on Wednesday. They dont feel how it feels to be attacked by rockets, and I think part of it is to actually experience what Israel is dealing with on a daily basis, said Hotovely, a member of Netanyahus right-wing Likud party. While Israel has often quarreled with American Jews over their right to advise it from afar, Hotovelys remarks went further by appearing to insinuate they are not fully committed to their native country, a notion U.S. Jewish organizations have long fought against in their battle against anti-Semitism. In a statement, Netanyahu, who also serves as Israels foreign minister, denounced Hotovelys comments as hurtful. There is no place for such a harangue and her remarks do not reflect the State of Israels position, the statement said.

The ACLU says tens of thousands of Georgia voters who moved within the same county were illegally told they would be considered inactive unless they responded to a notice confirming their address. The dispute centers around whether election officials can send a confirmation notice to individuals who move within the same county, threatening to make them inactive voters unless they respond in 30 days. The ACLU says in cases when someone moves within the same election jurisdiction, state officials are obligated to automatically update the rolls and voters shouldnt have to take any action to stay in the rolls. In Fulton county, election officials sent 48,954 notices to people who had moved in the area in the past two years and submitted a change of address form to the U.S. Postal Service, but did not update their voter registration information. In a letter to Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp (R) this month, the ACLU alleged the notices were a violation of federal and state voting law, which they said requires officials to update voter registrations on their own when someone moves within the same election jurisdiction. The notice gives voters 30 days to return it to state election officials confirming their information. If they fail to return it, the notice tells them they will be placed on a list of inactive voters. Being an inactive voter in Georgia does not block someone from voting, but initiates the years-long process by which a voter can be kicked off the rolls. Megan Harrison, a Fulton county resident, moved a few apartments down the hall in her building in November of 2016. In July, she received the notice from the state telling her she needed to confirm her addressed or else she would become an inactive voter. Harrison told  she isnt sure if she would respond to the notice, but had alerted the ACLU about it. In a July 11 letter to Kemp and Mary Carole Cooney, the chair of the Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections the ACLU demanded the officials update the voter registration lists and then inform voters they do not need to take any further action. The ACLU threatened a civil lawsuit if the officials failed to take action in 90 days. Candice Broce, a Kemp spokeswoman, said 383,487 confirmation notices were sent to voters statewide as part of the states regular voter list maintenance, but she was unsure of how many were sent to people who had moved within the same county. Sean Young, legal director of ACLU of Georgia, told  the organization was aware of at least two additional counties where voters were voters received confirmation notices after moving in the same county. On Friday, ACLU lawyers filed a public records request seeking more information from the state on who was sent confirmation notices. Rene Gordon, a math tutor, received the notice recently even though she only moved within Cobb county a little over a year ago. Gordon, who described herself as a frequent voter, said she didnt bother to update her voter registration because her new home was only about 10 minutes from her old one. She did change her address with USPS over a year ago and when she got the notice from the state threatening her with inactive status, she thought it meant she would be blocked from voting when she went to the polls, so she quickly responded to the letter. Im a little embarrassed to even admit it, I had assumed that meant I wouldnt be able to vote. Now, I talked to another reporter last week and she told me actually inactive means you cant vote, but at the time in my shoes when I received the letter, I certainly was alarmed because I thought it was a threat to my ability to vote, she said in an interview. I thought Im gonna go to the polls in the next election and theyre gonna turn me away. Because they only give me 30 days to respond, its even more alarming. I thought Im gonna go to the polls in the next election and theyre gonna turn me away.' Rene Gordon, Georgia voter. Stacey Hopkins moved within a 15-minute drive of her old home and within Fulton county in October 2016. But at the beginning of July received the notice saying she was at risk of being put on the inactive voter list. She said the letter looked like a solicitation and had it not been for her previous work on prior campaigns, she might have ignored it. To be perfectly honest, I was pissed, Hopkins said in an interview. She added was refusing to respond to the notice as an act of defiance. In its letter, the ACLU pointed to a subsection of Section 8 of the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, which says in the case of a change of address, for voting purposes, of a registrant to another address within the same registrars jurisdiction, the registrar shall correct the voting registration list accordingly, and the registrants name may not be removed from the official list of eligible voters by reason of such a change of address. That provision does, however, provide exceptions for states to kick people off the rolls as part of broad efforts to maintain voter lists. The group also pointed to a section of Georgia law noting that while the secretary of state can compare voter rolls to USPS change of address forms, the voter rolls shall be changed to reflect the new address. The law requires the secretary of state to send voters a form to correct any errors, but does not say they need to affirm their information in order to stay eligible to vote. Broce disputed the state couldnt send the notice to voters who moved within the same county. Our legal interpretation differs. Under federal and state law, we are required to conduct regular maintenance of Georgias voter rolls. It ensures that our records are accurate and works to preserve the integrity of our electoral system, she said in a statement. If an individual files a National Change of Address (NCOA) form with USPS, the Secretary of States office receives notice of the filing from USPS, and county officials send a letter to the voter to see if his address on file is still accurate. If a voter does not respond to the letter within 30 days, he is moved to inactive status in the voter registration database. Inactive status does not prevent a voter from voting, and it does not make it more difficult to vote. No one is being removed from the rolls as part of the NCOA process, which occurs every other year. Contrary to the ACLUs characterization of this process, it is no purge. Earlier this year, a Georgia federal judge dismissed a lawsuit challenging Georgias voting procedures. In that lawsuit, plaintiffs alleged that Georgias practice of sending confirmation notices to people who hadnt voted in three years violated NVRA, but U.S. District court judge Timothy Batten sided with the state. The case is being appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.","article_id":"3893545","cause_effect":{"ACLU Threatens Action Against Georgia":["Voter Confirmation Notices"]}},{"id":"4044937","title":"If Justin Fairfax Is Forced Out in Virginia, Whos Next in Line?","lead":"There is no clear succession plan should the states lieutenant governor leave office amid allegations of sexual assault.","body":"Coalescing scandals have engulfed Virginias leaders, plunging the state into political free fall.

David Hogg, a Parkland survivor who has appeared on dozens of national television programs since the shooting said that the walkout is a sign of change. The mood, much like the weather this morning, is cold but its hard and to the point, Hogg said. We know that weve had this change, we know that weve seen the suffering and loss but now, instead of closing up like many other communities before us, we must stand up, walk out and speak up against these acts of violence. According to the New York Post, dozens of New York City schools participated in the walkout. In many instances, school administrations helped orchestrate the walkouts with their students. The Post reported that hundreds of students walked out of Stuyvesant High School, several chanting, Hey, hey, NRA, how many kids did you kill today? Democratic Mayor Bill De Blasio praised the student protesters, suggesting that this may be the most powerful American student movement ever. There has never been a more powerful movement than what the students of Brooklyn and New York City and this nation have done in these last few weeks, De Blasio said. You are making so clear to this whole country that you are sick of the violence, youre sick of the madness, youre sick of the slaughter and you wont stand for it, he added. De Blasio said that students who peacefully participated in the 17-minute protest at New York City public schools would not be disciplined for their conduct.","article_id":"4296051","cause_effect":{"Thousands of Students Walk Out of School to Advocate":["to pay tribute to the students that passed away in the recent Parkland shooting and to bring awareness to recent calls for gun control.","for Gun Control"],"Thousands of students walked out of class on Wednesday morning":["to pay tribute to the students that passed away in the recent Parkland shooting and to bring awareness to recent calls for gun control.","for Gun Control"]}},{"id":"115945383","title":"Aid groups warn of chaos after Mosul civilians told to flee","lead":"Aid groups warn of chaos after Mosul civilians told to flee","body":"Aid groups voiced concern for the safety of civilians following calls from Iraq's government for residents of the Islamic State group-held Old City neighborhood in Mosul to flee the area immediately. Iraqi forces began the push to retake the neighborhood Saturday morning, moving in on the district from three directions, according to a statement from Nineveh operations command, the authority overseeing the Mosul fight. The IS hold on Mosul has shrunk to just a handful of neighborhoods in and around the Old City district where narrow streets and a dense civilian population is expected to complicate the fight there. Iraqi planes dropped leaflets over the area Friday telling civilians to flee 'immediately' to 'safe passages' where they will be greeted by 'guides, protectors and (transportation) to reach safe places,' according to a government statement. However, it is unclear how the government intends to ensure safe passage for civilians as IS fighters have repeatedly targeted fleeing civilians with small arms and mortar fire. The move to clear the Old City marks a shift in approach. Since the Mosul operation was launched in October Iraqi forces have encouraged civilians to remain in their homes to avoid massive displacement. However, more than 730,000 people have fled the fight to date according to United Nations figures. 'As many as 200,000 additional people may try to leave in coming days,' the U.N. said Saturday in a statement following the call for Old City civilians to leave. Save the Children warned that fleeing civilians could be caught in the crossfire, leading to 'deadly chaos' in a statement Friday. Both Iraqi forces and IS fighters are obligated under international law to protect civilians, the U.N. statement added. More than 100,000 civilians are estimated to still be inside IS-held Mosul neighborhoods. Mosul's eastern half was declared liberated in January and the push for the city's west began the following month. While some Iraqi commanders said they hoped to retake the city before Ramadan, the Muslim holy month that began Friday night, grueling urban combat has repeatedly slowed the pace of operations.","article_id":"115945383","cause_effect":{"Mosul civilians told to flee":["Aid groups warn of chaos"]}},{"id":"18342338","title":"Football told to root out 'vile cancer' of sectarianism","lead":"Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf reserves the right to take action if clubs do not act to tackle sectarianism.","body":"Image copyright PA Image caption Sectarianism was described as a 'vile cancer' - and not just connected to football. Football clubs have been warned that the Scottish government will act if they do not root out sectarianism in the sport. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the 'vile cancer' was a societal problem, and was not just connected to football. But he said there were far too many incidents of sectarianism around football grounds. He said clubs must say how they will tackle the problem - and if not, 'all options' remain on the table. It comes after a recent Scottish Police Authority board meeting heard how offensive behaviour at Scottish football matches had increased in the last year. Officers have been attacked and spat on and a police horse also required treatment after it was hit with a flare, the board heard. Image copyright SNS Image caption Kris Boyd and Steve Clarke have been subjected to recent sectarian abuse Mr Yousaf also announced an additional GBP530,000 for anti-sectarian organisations, bringing the total allocated to GBP14m since 2012. The government's controversial Offensive Behaviour at Football Act, introduced in 2012, was repealed in 2018. Sectarianism, once dubbed 'Scotland's shame', recently returned to the headlines after Kilmarnock manager Steve Clarke highlighted the verbal abuse he received from Rangers fans. Kilmarnock and ex-Rangers striker Kris Boyd also spoke out about chants he was subjected to by Celtic supporters. Others to have shared their negative experiences of life in the Old Firm spotlight include Chris Sutton and Neil McCann. Speaking to  Scotland, Mr Yousaf said he would be prepared to legislate again. Image caption Mr Yousaf said licensing laws could be examined among efforts to crack down on offensive behaviour. He said: 'When it comes to legislation, my challenge to the football clubs and others is: 'Show me how you're going to act. Tell me how you're going to root this out'. 'But if you don't then we reserve the right to act. 'And I'll look at legislation we currently have, like licensing laws for example. I'll look at potential solutions like strict liability for example, and we will not rule them out and we will not take them off the table. 'So all the options remain very firmly on the table.' Combating bigotry Mr Yousaf said the government would do whatever was within its power to tackle bigotry, including at football, marches and parades or in work places. As he announced grants to projects tackling the issue at school-level, he said education was pivotal. A grant of GBP85,000 was given to Sense Over Sectarianism (SOS), which supports pupils in Glasgow to recognise and combat bigotry and provides training for teachers across the country. Development officer, Mark Adams said: 'In the past 12 months SOS has worked with unprecedented numbers and this funding gives the programme a solid platform to build on and consolidate this success. 'In addition we will be able to once again host the national month of action for Scottish schools which proved very popular in February of this year.' 'Lacking leadership' Another project to benefit from the new round of funding was Nil By Mouth, which provides free anti-sectarian education in workplaces. Director Dave Scott said: 'We have seen huge interest in our tackling sectarianism in the workplace programme in recent years with more than 125 employers participating, including more than a third of Scottish local authorities. 'Scotland is bigger, better and bolder than bigotry and this welcome investment in grassroots projects like ours will take that message to schools, colleges, universities, workplaces and communities right across the country and help people find their voices on this issue.' Prof Duncan Morrow, former chair of the independent Advisory Group on Tackling Sectarianism in Scotland, said: 'The past few months have shown that sectarianism remains a problem in Scotland. 'There is no doubting that progress has been made, especially in communities, but it will continue to rear its head if it is not faced and addressed firmly. 'I am pleased that the Scottish government remains committed to tackling sectarianism, and hope that others outside of government will now show the leadership that has been lacking for so long.'","article_id":"18342338","cause_effect":{"Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf reserves the right to take action":["if clubs do not act to tackle sectarianism."]}},{"id":"3889177","title":"Larry Nassar Moved To Prison For High-Profile Inmates After Alleged Assault","lead":"The former USA Gymnastics team doctor was moved to a 'safer' facility in Florida after he was allegedly attacked in an Arizona prison.","body":"JEFF KOWALSKY via Getty Images Former Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar addresses the court during the sentencing phase in Ingham County Circuit Court on Jan. 24, 2018, in Lansing, Michigan. Prison officials recently transferred former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor Larry Nassar to a Florida federal prison in an attempt to keep the convicted pedophile safe. As of Tuesday, the Federal Bureau of Prisons website showed that Nassar is being housed at USP Coleman II, a high-security prison in Sumterville, Florida, about 50 miles northwest of Orlando. The prison currently houses high-profile inmates, including James Whitey Bulger, an infamous organized crime kingpin from Boston. The move comes a month after Nassars attorneys said fellow inmates assaulted the former doctor while he was in general population at the United States Penitentiary in Tucson, Arizona, where he is serving his 60-year sentence for child pornography charges. Last week, Nassar was transferred to a facility in Oklahoma City before moving to the new facility in Florida. USP Coleman II, which holds around 1,400 male inmates at a time, is known to house high-profile or vulnerable prisoners such as sex offenders, informants and former police officers. Historically, these types of offenders are more likely to be attacked or killed while in prison. Nate Lindell, a former prisoner at USP Coleman II, described the facility as a safe place for people like Nassar in a 2016 essay for The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that covers the criminal justice system. USP Coleman II is a so-called special-needs prison  a safe facility where informants, former cops, ex-gang members, check-ins (prisoners who intentionally put themselves in solitary confinement to be safe), homosexuals, and sex offenders can all, supposedly, walk the Yard freely. At regular BOP lockups, these types of men are in danger of being beaten, stabbed, or strangled to death, Lindell wrote. Nassar, 55, is accused of sexually abusing more than 265 young women under the guise of medical treatment. He was sentenced to three concurrent prison sentences over the past year, including the 60-year sentence on child pornography charges which he is currently serving.","article_id":"3889177","cause_effect":{"Larry Nassar Moved To Prison For High-Profile Inmates":["after he was allegedly attacked in an Arizona prison.","After Alleged Assault"],"The former USA Gymnastics team doctor was moved to a 'safer' facility in Florida":["after he was allegedly attacked in an Arizona prison.","After Alleged Assault"]}},{"id":"4617013","title":"Study: Climate change possible cause of bird species decline","lead":"Climate change could be to blame for the collapse of bird populations in the desert along the Nevada-California border, scientists said.","body":"Climate change could be to blame for the collapse of bird populations in the desert along the Nevada-California border, scientists said. The number of bird species has fallen by an average of 43 percent over the past century at survey sites across an area larger than New York state, according to a new study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. The study shows almost a third of species are less common and widespread now than they once were throughout the region. The study's authors, Steven Beissinger and Kelly Iknayan, point to less hospitable conditions in the Mojave Desert as the probable cause. 'California deserts have already experienced quite a bit of drying and warming because of climate change, and this might be enough to push birds over the edge,' said Iknayan, who conducted the research for her doctoral thesis at UC Berkeley. 'It seems like we are losing part of the desert ecosystem.' 'The Mojave Desert is now nearly half empty of birds,' said Beissinger, a UC Berkeley professor of environmental science, policy and management. 'This appears to be a new baseline, and we don't know if it's stable or if it will continue to decline.' The researchers spent three years searching for birds at 61 locations on both sides of the border, including survey sites in the Spring Mountains and at Desert National Wildlife Refuge, just outside of Las Vegas, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported . They also surveyed sites across Death Valley and Joshua Tree national parks and Mojave National Preserve, Iknayan revisited the same sites UC Berkeley biologist Joseph Grinnell and his colleagues surveyed between 1908 and 1947. Iknayan and Beissinger found that areas with reduced rainfall lost more birds species than sites that remained wetter. Their findings were published earlier this month in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Researchers are calling it a collapse because it has occurred across the entire desert bird community. 'Studies elsewhere have found that climate change typically makes places unfavorable for some birds but opens the door for others to come in,' Iknayan said. 'In the desert, we are not seeing increases in any of our species except for the common raven.

Odinga spoke on Sunday to a cheering crowd in Nairobi's Kibera slum, an opposition stronghold and a frequent scene of clashes between stone-throwing protesters and police firing live ammunition and tear gas since the Aug. 8 election in which President Uhuru Kenyatta was declared the winner. Odinga's defiance fueled continuing uncertainty in Kenya, an East African economic hub whose reputation for stability has been shaken by election violence and court challenges in the past. 'There is no work until Tuesday, when we will announce the next step,' said Odinga, who previously claimed that last week's vote was rigged. Kenya's election commission said its process was fair, and international observers praised its handling of the election in this country of 45 million people. The opposition leader's announcement left Kenyans wondering whether Odinga could press his case that there was vote-tampering and even escalate the situation by calling for protests. One of his deputies previously ruled out the option of going to court, recalling Odinga's unsuccessful legal challenge after he lost the 2013 election. Some analysts believe it is unlikely that he would effectively acknowledge defeat at this stage. Odinga also lost a 2007 election, which was followed by ethnic-fueled violence in which more than 1,000 people were killed. He was made prime minister in a power-sharing agreement aimed at defusing tension. Opposition areas, including Kibera, another Nairobi slum called Mathare and the city of Kisumu, were mostly quiet on Sunday morning, with many people attending church services and police patrolling some streets. However, protesters threw stones and police lobbed tear gas, according to Associated Press journalists on the scene. Also Sunday, Odinga visited the mother of a 9-year-old daughter who was killed by a stray bullet during clashes between police and protesters in the Mathare slum on Saturday. Police gunfire has killed at least 24 people since the election, according to the state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, which monitors government institutions. However police denied the report on Sunday, saying police have killed six 'criminals' who were looting, rioting and attacking police officers in the past two days. There was 'a plot to kill our supporters,' Odinga said in his brief remarks to supporters. On Twitter, he said people should observe a day of mourning on Monday for 'fallen patriots.' However, presidential spokesman Manoah Esipisu said Sunday that the protests were violent and unlawful, and that any peaceful protests are a constitutional right and would be protected by police. 'But sadly, we have seen violent protests, in which property has been damaged, and lives have been endangered,' Esipisu said. 'The violent protests are unlawful, so let me be perfectly clear here: The police will not tolerate breaches of the peace; instead, they will protect the lives and property of Kenyans; and they will restore law and order.'

Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said Thursday that Harkatul Jihad chief Mufti Hannan and one accomplice were hanged at Kashimpur Jail outside the capital, Dhaka, late Wednesday. The third man was executed in the northeastern district of Sylhet, also late Wednesday. The High Court and the Supreme Court had upheld their death sentences given by a trial court in 2008 and the president rejected their clemency appeals. Harkatul Jihad wanted to introduce Sharia law in Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority nation of 160 million people that is governed by secular laws based on British common law. The group has targeted left-leaning cultural groups and rallies of the now-ruling Bangladesh Awami League led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. It is blamed for other attacks between 1999 and 2005 that claimed more than 100 lives. Hannan was one of the most dreaded radical Islamists in Bangladesh. He joined the war in Afghanistan against the Soviets and was injured there in 1990. He became the top leader of the Harkatul Jihad in Bangladesh after his return to the country. The group was founded in Pakistan, where Hannan studied previously.

I have been in touch with them because obviously you dont just mention peoples names without checking that theyre OK with that, Ms Swinson told BBC Radio 4s Today programme on Friday, stating that neither want to see a no-deal Brexit. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to take the UK out of the EU by October 31st, with or without a deal, and has ramped up preparations for a clean exit, but is facing challenges from the Remainer-dominated parliament which refuses to deliver on the will of the people who voted to leave the EU in June 2016.

There was also opposition within the Liberal Democrat party to their leaders backing of the Conservative Ken Clarke, with sources telling The Telegraph that the Tory grandees support for a renegotiated, soft-Brexit deal over a second referendum to stop Brexit altogether goes against their core policy of remaining in the EU.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. By Minyvonne Burke An Illinois mother has been charged in her daughter's death after police say she hid the teenage girl's medical diagnosis and prevented her from getting proper treatment. Amber Hampshire, 39, of the city of Alton in southern Illinois was charged Thursday with one count involuntary manslaughter and one count of endangering the life or health of a child in connection to her 14-year-old daughter Emily's death in November, according to a press release from Madison County State's Attorney Tom Gibbons. An investigation found that the mother 'was fully aware of Emilys diabetic condition but took measures to conceal Emilys diabetes and failed to provide Emily with appropriate medical treatment and medication, which led to Emilys death from diabetic ketoacidosis,' the press release stated. The girl had allegedly been diagnosed with diabetes in 2013, but doctors at the hospital where she was taken in November weren't made aware of it until after her death, the press release said. Calls made to the Hampshire family by  were not immediately returned. Emily was hospitalized on Nov. 1, 2018, after paramedics responded to her home on a report that she was unresponsive and not breathing. She was taken to a local hospital in Illinois before being transferred to a hospital in St. Louis, where she died two days later on Nov. 3. The girls mother allegedly told hospital doctors in St. Louis that her daughter had been previously hospitalized elsewhere in February 2018 for pneumonia and that she had been told that Emily had high sugar levels at the time, but insulin wasnt prescribed, NBC-affiliate KSDK reported, based on court documents. Doctors said that they had requested copies of Emily's medical records, but Hampshire blocked them from getting them, according to KSDK. It wasn't until after Emily's death and when doctors were finally able to obtain her medical records that they learned the teen had been diagnosed with diabetes five years ago, according to the court documents cited by the news outlet. It is also alleged that Hampshire had been instructed to bring Emily to three follow-up appointments following her February 2018 hospitalization, but did not do so. A detective investigating the teens death said Emilys school had also been made aware that the teen had diabetes but Hampshire, who had been working at the school at the time, allegedly said the diagnosis was a mistake, KSDK reported. Days after Emilys death, police obtained a search warrant and found medications for diabetes as well as various equipment used to treat someone with the disease at Hampshires home. The teens phone was also seized by police to see if it contained any evidence, according to the outlet. If convicted, Hampshire faces up to 14 years in prison for the manslaughter charge and up to 10 years for the charge of endangering the life of a minor.","article_id":"55220080","cause_effect":{"Emily's death in November, according to a press release from Madison County State's Attorney Tom Gibbons.":["An investigation found that the mother 'was fully aware of Emilys diabetic condition"],"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Details are being kept closely under wraps, in stark contrast to last month's Manchester bombing, when photos and information from the investigation were repeatedly leaked to the media. There has been no official information on the identity of any of the three attackers. This comes despite a series of police raids and upwards of 12 arrests across the capital, including two new raids on Monday morning at addresses in Newham and Barking in east London. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Sunday night, although they provided no evidence for their involvement or details of the attack. Seven people have been confirmed dead by police but only one of the victims has been identified so far, Canadian woman Chrissy Archibald who moved to Europe to be with her fiance. Another 36 men and women are currently in hospital, 21 of whom are in a critical condition, according to emergency services. A memorial is planned for 6pm local time Monday, in the capital's Potters Field Park to commemorate those affected, as the city continues to digest its second terrorist attack in two months London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the city's 'anger and grief' was indescribable. 'We are all shocked and angry today but this is our city. We will never let these cowards win and we will never be cowed by terrorism,' he said in a statement.

Neighbor saw attacker teaching children to pray Monday's early morning raids follow raids on a housing complex in Barking east London Sunday, where 11 people were arrested -- five men and six women, aged between 19 to 60. All of them were arrested in the same complex, according to Britain's most senior counterterrorism official, Mark Rowley.

A 55-year-old man, who had been previously arrested, was later released without having to post bail. Ikenna Chigbo, in an interview with Britain's Independent Television News, described another of the arrested men as a nice guy who regularly invited neighbors to barbecues and played football and table tennis with them. 'Yesterday -- I'm actually in the process of moving home at the moment -- I hired a van moving some bits. He came to me. He was a little bit overnice,' Chigbo told the station. 'He said to me, 'Where can I get a van like that?' Asking me all the details like how much was it, where he could get a van -- basically because, he said to me, 'I might be moving shortly with my family as well.''

MUST WATCH Clarissa Ward describes how Londoners are reacting 01:25 'Unprecedented' action by police As the UK returned to normal Monday morning, details continued to emerge about the quick response of police to Sunday's terrorist attack. Three men drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge late Saturday night, before abandoning the vehicle at nearby Borough Market. They then got out of the car and began stabbing people at random until police arrived and shot all three dead. An 'unprecedented' number of rounds had been fired at the three attackers by police, who ended their rampage just eight minutes after the London Bridge incident was reported. The three attackers were wearing what appeared to be suicide belt, which later turned out to be fake. Rowley said it was probable they had worn them to ensure they were killed by police. Parts of London near where the attack took place are still cordoned off on Monday morning, police said, leaving some residents unable to access their homes. 'We advise residents they will not be able to access properties until cordon is lifted. Thank you for your patience and cooperation,' police tweeted. Three days until election The rush to dismantle the London Bridge attackers' network comes just days before the UK is scheduled to go to the polls. Voting in the general election will begin at 7 a.m. on June 8, local time, to decide whether UK Prime Minister May will be returned as the country's leader. The Conservatives, Labour and the Scottish National Party all suspended campaigning Sunday for the second time this election. All parties had previously canceled events after the bombing in Manchester outside an Ariana Grande concert in May. Polls had tightened dramatically in recent weeks, eliminating an early overwhelming lead for May's Conservative Party, although it's unclear how the two terrorist attacks could affect the result. Speaking at Ford Theater in Washington Sunday night, US President Donald Trump described the incident as a 'horrific terrorist attack.' 'The bloodshed must end. The bloodshed will end. As president I will do what is necessary to prevent this threat from spreading to our shores,' he told reporters.","article_id":"5085257","cause_effect":{"More than 24 hours after three men rampaged through central London killing seven and injuring 48, little is known about the attackers or the victims of the assault":["ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Sunday night, although they provided no evidence for their involvement or details of the attack."],"ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Sunday night, although they provided no evidence for their involvement or details of the attack.":["This comes despite a series of police raids and upwards of 12 arrests across the capital,"]}},{"id":"4883114","title":"Syria: Suicide attacks kill dozens in Homs city","lead":"Suicide attacks targeting two security centers in the regime-held western Syrian city of Homs killed at least 32 people and wounded 24 others, state media said.","body":"Story highlights State TV says six suicide bombers carried out the attacks in two neighborhoods A Syrian umbrella organization that includes a jihadist group has claimed responsibility () Suicide attacks targeting two security centers in the regime-held central Syrian city of Homs killed at least 32 people and wounded 24 others, according to state media citing the city's Gov.

The site reported that, according to neighbors who knew the boy, due to his special condition, the boy ran away when he saw the police and police, without speaking to him, shot at him. Neighbors say they witnessed the incident and attempted to chase after the officers who shot Hernandez, but they fled. Venezuelan journalist Roman Camacho added that, according to witnesses, the Bolivarian National Police (PNB) officers involved were accompanied by colectivosarmed chavista gangs the government enables to intimidate and kill opposition protestersand that special units were deployed and took away the boys body. As of Wednesday morning, protests continued in the boys name. The incident is the latest such death. On Tuesday, for example, Dolar Today reports that a water utility truck ran over a youth amid a protest in Bolivar city. The Venezuelan site Runrunes identifies the boy as 17-year-old Oswaldo Britt, and notes that protesters had set the government utility truck in question on fire. On Monday night, a 55-year-old professor identified as Janeth Angulo Parra was killed attempting to join protesters in Lara state, urging them to lift a roadblock. She died bludgeoned to the head, according to El Nacional, though it was unclear whether the National Guard shot her or hurled a projectile at her to end her life. Runrunes running tally of deaths since protests began on April 1 now shows that 113 people have died since that day amid state violence against peaceful protesters. Young men and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to state violence, killed by gunshots, tear gas canisters hurled at their heads, and run over with armored tanks. Violence against young Venezuelans is not new, however. Nearly 10,000 underaged Venezuelans were killed in 2015defined as people between the ages of fifteen and twentyand 854 people under 15 were killed in violent circumstances, according to an NGO active in the country. A year before that, the murder of Kluivert Roa, a 14-year-old from western San Cristobal, made global headlines. The socialist national guard shot Roa to death after he noticed a violent incident involving troops on his way home from school and shouted stop the repression! at them. This week, the NGO Amnesty International issued a demand for the government to cease using state violence against peaceful dissidents. Recurrent attacks against the Venezuelan population and speeches inciting violence by the authorities indicate a premeditated policy of violent repression of any form of dissent, Amnesty International said today after a further increase in deaths during demonstrations, with at least 91 cases registered in only three months, a press release read. Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International denounced a planned strategy by the government of President Maduro to use violence and illegitimate force against the Venezuelan population to neutralize any criticism.","article_id":"4320505","cause_effect":{"Venezuelans have congregated in a Caracas neighborhood to protest the death of a boy with Down syndrome, who reports claim police shot to death after he reflexively fled the scene of law enforcement activity.":["The Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional reported that the child in question was ten years old, and was killed in the Libertador municipal area of Caracas."]}}]
