      "Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the longest-serving Republican senator, announced Tuesday he will not seek reelection in November. The move sets the stage for a likely run for his seat by former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney.\n",
      "“Every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves. And for me, that time is soon approaching,\" the 83-year-old senator, who was first elected in 1976, said in a video announcement. \"That’s why after much prayer and discussion with family and friends, I’ve decided to retire at the end of this term.”\n",
      "Story Continued Below\n",
      "The news caps months of speculation about Hatch’s political future. President Donald Trump tried aggressively to persuade the Hatch to seek another term, orchestrating a visit to Utah in which the president lavished praise on the senator and rode with him on Air Force One.\n",
      "Trump’s move was aimed in no small part at keeping Romney out of the Senate. During the 2016 campaign, Romney emerged as a de facto leader of the “Never Trump” movement, calling then-candidate Trump a “fraud” and “phony” who was unfit to serve.\n",
      "The two warmed to each other somewhat after the election, when Trump considered Romney to be his secretary of state. Yet the president and his closest advisers remain suspicious of the former Massachusetts governor. Romney has at times gone out of his way to criticize the new president, including for his response to white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year.\n",
      "An announcement from Senator Orrin G. Hatch. #utpol pic.twitter.com/UeItaLjR3j — Senator Hatch Office (@senorrinhatch) January 2, 2018\n",
      "With Hatch out of the race, Romney will be the heavy favorite. The former Massachusetts governor, who is now residing in Utah, is widely popular in the state. He has spent the last few months huddling with key players in the state to discuss a prospective bid, including prominent businessman Kem Gardner and state House speaker Greg Hughes.\n",
      "In a statement posted to Facebook Tuesday afternoon, Romney made no mention of a potential Senate bid.\n",
      "\"I join the people of Utah in thanking my friend, Senator Orrin Hatch for his more than 40 years of service to our great state and nation,\" Romney said. \"As Chairman of the Senate Finance and Judiciary Committees and as the longest-serving Republican senator in U.S. history, Senator Hatch has represented the interests of Utah with distinction and honor. Ann and I wish Senator Orrin Hatch and his loving wife Elaine all the best in their future endeavors.\"\n",
      "Hatch, who as the most senior Senate Republican serves as president pro tempore and is third in line for the presidency, had been coy for months about whether he would seek an eighth term in office — particularly as the Republican tax overhaul effort unfolded on Capitol Hill.\n",
      "As chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, Hatch recently helped shepherd through the biggest change to the tax code in a generation. The legislation slashed the corporate tax rate and reduced individual rates, while scrapping a key provision of Obamacare that required everyone to hold insurance.\n",
      "Though the tax effort was contentious and partisan, Hatch also built up a record during his four decades on Capitol Hill of working with influential Democrats to produce landmark bills.\n",
      "One is the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which Hatch created alongside the late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) in 1997. Funding for the law lapsed Sept. 30, although Congress has passed a short-term infusion of money for the popular program benefiting 9 million lower-income children.\n",
      "Hatch and Kennedy had struck a close friendship: A songwriter in his free time, Hatch penned a tune for the Massachusetts Democrat when he remarried in 1992.\n",
      "Hatch, who also chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee, was among the first senators to support the Dream Act with Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) in 2001 — legislation that would create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as minors.\n",

      "Newsstands soon could be stripped of one of the nation’s most iconic publications: Playboy magazine.\n",
      "Playboy Enterprises Inc. reportedly is considering killing the print magazine, which was started more than six decades ago by Hugh Hefner, who died in September.\n",
      "Famous for its racy images of naked women, the magazine launched Hefner’s Beverly Hills-based publishing and entertainment empire. But Hefner’s death has triggered a process that will shift ownership of the company from his family to the largest shareholder, private equity firm Rizvi Traverse, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.\n",
      "Ben Kohn, a managing partner at Rizvi who is Playboy Enterprises’ chief executive, wants to shift the company’s emphasis to brand partnerships and licensing deals.\n",
      "“We want to focus on what we call the ‘World of Playboy’ which is so much larger than a small, legacy print publication,” Kohn told the Journal. “We plan to spend 2018 transitioning it from a media business to a brand-management company.”\n",
      "That shift involves seriously considering ending the print magazine, which began in 1953. U.S. circulation has dropped to less than 500,000 an issue from a peak of 5.6 million in 1975 amid struggles in the broader print magazine industry.\n",
      "The Journal said Playboy’s print magazine, which now publishes six issues a year, has lost as much as $7 million annually in recent years.\n",
      "“Historically, we could justify the losses because of the marketing value, but you also have to be forward thinking,” Kohn said. “I’m not sure that print is necessarily the best way to communicate to our consumer.”\n",
      "John Vlautin, a spokesman for Playboy Enterprises, declined to comment Tuesday. A spokesman for Rizvi Traverse did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "In 2016, Playboy stopped publishing fully nude photos of women as part of a redesign of the print magazine that reflected the widespread availability of such imagery online. But last year, naked women were back in Playboy, and Cooper Hefner — the founder’s son and the company’s chief creative officer — said the ban was a mistake.\n",
      "“Nudity was never the problem because nudity isn’t a problem,” Cooper Hefner wrote on Twitter at the time. “Today we’re taking our identity back and reclaiming who we are.”\n",
      "Rizvi Traverse helped Hugh Hefner take Playboy private in 2011 and received control of nearly two-thirds of the company. As part of the deal, Rizvi Traverse agreed to keep publishing the magazine for as long as Hefner lived.\n",
      "The private equity firm now is in talks to acquire the 35% stake Hefner left in trust to his heirs, the Journal said, quoting an unnamed person familiar with the matter.\n",
      "Playboy wants to raise $25 million to $100 million early this year to help buy back the shares and fund future partnership deals, the person told the Journal.\n",

      "BALTIMORE -- Baltimore has set a new per-capita homicide record as gunmen killed for drugs, cash, payback - or no apparent reason at all.\n",
      "A surge of homicides in the starkly divided city resulted in 343 killings in 2017, bringing the annual homicide rate to its highest ever - roughly 56 killings per 100,000 people. Baltimore, which has shrunk over decades, currently has about 615,000 inhabitants.\n",
      "\"Not only is it disheartening, it's painful,\" Mayor Catherine Pugh told The Associated Press during the final days of 2017, her first year in office.\n",
      "The main reasons are the subject of endless interpretation. Some attribute the increase to more illegal guns, the fallout of the opioid epidemic, or systemic failures like unequal justice and a scarcity of decent opportunities for many citizens. The tourism-focused Inner Harbor and prosperous neighborhoods such as Canton and Mount Vernon are a world away from large sections of the city hobbled by generational poverty.\n",
      "Others blame police, accusing them of taking a hands-off approach to fighting crime since six officers were charged in connection with the 2015 death of Freddie Gray, a black man whose fatal spinal cord injury in police custody triggered massive protests that year and the city's worst riots in decades.\n",
      "\"The conventional wisdom, or widely agreed upon speculation, suggests that the great increase in murders is happening partly because the police have withdrawn from aggressively addressing crime in the city's many poor, crime-ridden neighborhoods,\" said Donald Norris, professor emeritus of public policy at the University of Maryland Baltimore County.\n",
      "Even as arrests have declined to their lowest level in years, police say their officers are working hard in a tough environment. They note the overwhelming majority of Baltimore's crime has long been linked to gangs, drugs and illegal guns.\n",
      "\"The vast majority of our kids and residents of this city aren't into criminal activity like this. It's that same revolving group of bad guys that are wreaking havoc for people's families,\" said T.J. Smith, the chief police spokesman whose own younger brother was the city's 173rd homicide victim in 2017.\n",
      "Baltimore's homicide rate started to surge after Gray's death in 2015, a year when the city saw over 340 slayings. There's been a depressingly steady march of killings since.\n",
      "Violent crime rates in Baltimore have been notoriously high for decades and some locals sardonically refer to their city as \"Bodymore\" due to the annual body count. But prior to 2015, Baltimore's killings had generally been on the decline. Before rates in recent years eclipsed it, Baltimore's homicide rate had peaked with 353 killings in 1993, or some 49 killings per 100,000 people. Baltimore had over 700,000 inhabitants back then, making the per-capita rate lower than in 2017.\n",
      "Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist at New York University, described Baltimore as a place \"where there is an urgent need to make sure that neighborhoods do not continue to fall apart and the population doesn't give up on the city.\"\n",
      "Pugh, who took office as mayor in December 2016, said her year-old administration is focused on reducing crime, boosting police recruits, and improving long-neglected neighborhoods. She told attendees at a candlelight vigil she hosted for victims of violence that \"this will become the safest city in America.\"\n",
      "Attending the vigil were Norman and Yvonne Armstrong, who struggled for words to describe their heartache since losing their son, Shawn, to gun violence. The working family man, a 31-year-old father of three, was fatally shot at a Baltimore carwash in September. His murder is unsolved.\n",
      "AP\n",
      "\"The kids out there with guns don't care about anything,\" said Norman Armstrong, the pain of grief etched on his face.\n",
      "Among the names behind the 2017 numbers is Jonathan Tobash, a 19-year-old college student who embodied the best hopes of his Baltimore community. Police say the sophomore at Morgan State University was shot to death Dec. 18 after stumbling onto a robbery in progress outside a convenience store near his family's home.\n",
      "Ericka Alston-Buck, who founded the Kids Safe Zone community center in the rough Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood, said concentrated poverty must be addressed and a measure of healing has to take place in order to truly tackle high rates of violence in Baltimore.\n",
      "\"Hurt people hurt people. No one's doing anything to close those holes in their souls,\" she said. \"As long as no one does that, nothing is going to change.\"\n",

      "Trump's partly right — there were no commercial airline fatalities anywhere in the world last year, according to data from Aviation Safety Network. But aviation experts say there's no evidence the president has improved safety here or abroad, while his administration's policies could actually have a negative impact.\n",
      "“Airline safety in 2017 was the best that it has ever been. That is an ongoing trend that we have seen over the last 25 or 30 years, and it’s due to the efforts of literally thousands of people in manufacturing, operators, pilots, flight attendants, dispatchers, mechanics, regulators, and the safety organizations,” industry consultant and former U.S. airline captain John Cox told NBC News. “For one individual to try and take credit for it is not an accurate portrayal of what it took to accomplish it.”\n",

      "Paul Hudson, president of Flyerrights.org and a member of the Federal Aviation Administration's Advisory and Rulemaking Committee, told NBC News he hasn't seen any safety-improving measures enacted by the White House. Instead, he sees efforts that could hurt safety. The Trump administration is considering slashing hundreds of safety regulations, and has proposed slashing airport security funding and punting the cost to local authorities.\n",
      "The White House defended the president's tweet in a statement.\n",
      "\"President Trump has raised the bar for our nation’s aviation safety and security. Last year, the President announced his initiative to modernize Air Traffic Control and under his leadership, the Department of Homeland Security released enhanced security measures to ensure safer commercial air travel,\" Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary Raj Shah told NBC News.\n",
      "But the president's endorsement of a proposal to privatize air traffic control by detaching it from the FAA — announced in June 2017 as part of a larger week of infrastructure-related events at the White House — has been stalled since day one. It currently doesn’t have the votes in Congress.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the enhanced security measures Shah touts are anti-terror measures. According to Cox, the initial electronics restrictions, put in place in March 2017, created additional safety problems by forcing passengers departing from certain countries to check electronics for several months. Lithium battery fires happen fairly often on planes and are harder to detect in cargo, Cox said, and cargo storage sprinkler systems can’t always put them out. DHS announced in late June that it would replace the March ban with enhanced screening of electronics like laptops and devices larger than a cell phone.\n",
      "\"I haven’t seen any evidence that the White House has done anything to improve airline safety or get strict with airline safety,\" consumer airline advocate Chris Elliott told NBC News, noting that previous years were safe, too. (There hasn't been a commercial passenger airline crash in the U.S. since 2009.)\n",

      "Ryan Zinke has recommended three major marine monuments be reduced to allow greater commercial fishing, prompting anguish from environmental groups\n",
      "The Trump administration’s plan to shrink four land-based national monuments has provoked howls of anguish from environmental groups, Native American tribes and some businesses, such as the outdoors company Patagonia.\n",
      "In America and beyond, the spirit behind public lands is at risk | Hansjörg Wyss Read more\n",
      "Accompanying changes to protected monuments in the oceans – vastly larger areas than their land-based counterparts – have received less attention, but could have major consequences for the livelihoods and ecosystems dependent upon the marine environment.\n",
      "Ryan Zinke, the secretary of the interior, has recommended to Donald Trump that three sprawling marine monuments, one in the Atlantic and two in the Pacific, be either opened up to the commercial fishing industry or reduced in size, or both.\n",
      "“These ‘blue parks’ harbor unique species, a wealth of biodiversity and special habitats,” said Jane Lubchenco, the administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration between 2009 and 2013.\n",
      "“They are undersea treasures. I fervently hope that these incredible marine monuments will not be degraded by opening them up to extractive activities. There are plenty of other places in the ocean to fish.”\n",
      "In 2009, George W Bush created the Pacific Remote Islands national monument around seven islands and atolls in the central Pacific. The monument, subsequently expanded by Barack Obama to become what was the largest marine protected area in the world, comprises “the last refugia for fish and wildlife species rapidly vanishing from the remainder of the planet”, according to the Fish & Wildlife Service, boasting creatures such as sea turtles, dolphins, whales, sharks and giant clams.\n",
      "Zinke noted that the monument, which spans more than 490,500 sq miles, protects largely untouched coral reefs and marine species but also pushed out Hawaiian and American Samoan fishers who previously used long lines and huge scoop-like nets in the area. The interior secretary said the monument should be shrunk to an unspecified new shape and allow regional authorities to oversee commercial fishing in the monument.\n",
      "Trump has been handed similar recommendations for Rose Atoll, a 10,000 sq mile ecosystem in the south Pacific that was protected in 2009, with Zinke adding there is “no explanation” as to why there can’t be commercial fishing in America’s only protected area of the Atlantic, the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts.\n",
      "Combined, these marine monuments encompass an area more than three times the size of California – dwarfing the four terrestrial monuments set to be resized. But the land and sea monuments share common arguments over conservation, resource extraction and the role of the federal government to restrict certain activities in prized ecosystems.\n",
      "In March, a coalition of New England fishing organizations sued the federal government over the Obama administration’s creation of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts, an area of plunging rock formations that contain a wealth of cold water corals, located 130 miles off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts.\n",
      "The simple “stroke of President Obama’s pen” would put fishers out of work, said Beth Casoni, executive director of the Massachusetts Lobstermen’s Association. About 800,000lb of lobster are caught near the canyons each year.\n",
      "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Conservation groups say commercial fishing would be merely a precursor to further invasions into the marine environment. Photograph: Marty Melville/AFP/Getty Images\n",
      "“The monument designation will have a negative rippling effect across the region as fishermen will have to search for new fishing grounds – only to find they are already being fished,” Casoni said.\n",
      "The legal challenge, predicated on the claim that Obama exceeded his authority in naming the area a monument, was paused by the Trump administration’s review of national monuments declared since 1996. If Zinke’s recommendations are followed, commercial fishing could now be ushered back into the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts, beyond the two lobster and crab operators currently allowed in the area before a sunset clause bars them in six years’ time.\n",
      "Conservation groups fret that commercial fishing would only be a precursor to further invasions, such as oil drilling or seabed mining. The Atlantic monument is considered particularly sensitive due to its dense forests of deep-sea corals and its role as a migratory route for the endangered North Atlantic right whale, which has experienced an alarming dip in numbers this year.\n",
      "“This is a spectacular place that contains animals incredibly vulnerable to drilling, fishing, noise and pollution,” said Peter Baker, director of US oceans, north-east, at the Pew Charitable Trusts.\n",
      "“It shouldn’t be too much to ask to protect 2% of the US’s exclusive economic zone off the Atlantic coast for future generations. Allowing commercial fishing there is really a distortion of why you would have a national monument in the first place.”\n",
      "Baker said the New England Fisheries Management Council, which Zinke indicated should determine fishing restrictions in the monument, has a “horrible track record” of overfishing and conflicts of interest.\n",
      "Janice Plante, spokeswoman for the council, rejected that claim.\n",
      "“We work very hard to have sustainable fishing,” she said. “We had no position on the designation of the monument but we support [Zinke’s] recommendations because we would manage it the best. We have the expertise and the experience.”\n",
      "In the Pacific, the equivalent industry body, Western Pacific Fishery Management Council, has sought greater access for sought-after stock, such as bigeye tuna.\n",
      "Kitty Simonds, executive director of the council, said the review of national monuments “provides an opportunity for America to remember that it has the ability to protect marine ecosystems without closing more than half of the US Pacific island waters to fishing.”\n",
      "But ecologists argue that a doubling in the amount of tuna caught off Hawaii since 2006 is evidence that protection of key breeding and foraging ecosystems has not hindered the industry.\n",
      "“These monuments are like bank accounts, whereby the fishing industry can live off the interest, which is the reproductive output of the protected areas,” said Robert Richmond, a marine ecologist at the University of Hawaii.\n",
      "“Invalidating this management is nothing short of irresponsible and flies in the face of best science. It’s a race to the bottom, for the short-term gain of the fishing industry but to their long-term cost.”\n",
      "In US waters, comparatively well regulated compared with many other countries, more than a quarter of fish stocks are either overfished or severely depleted.\n",
      "“The US is among only a few nations who have taken significant steps to protect the vibrancy of its ocean treasures through large, highly protected blue parks,” said Lubchenco.\n",
      "“It is only recently that our technology has allowed us to mine, drill and fish virtually everywhere in the ocean. Creation of highly protected blue parks like these monuments is beginning to re-establish the all-important balance of places to be used and places to be treasured. We need both.”\n",
