      "The National Security Agency is losing its top talent at a worrisome rate as highly skilled personnel, some disillusioned with the spy service's leadership and an unpopular reorganization, take higher-paying, more flexible jobs in the private sector.\n",
      "Since 2015, the NSA has lost several hundred hackers, engineers and data scientists, according to current and former U.S. officials with knowledge of the matter. The potential impact on national security is significant, they said.\n",
      "Headquartered at Fort Meade in Maryland, the NSA employs a civilian workforce of about 21,000 there and is the largest producer of intelligence among the nation's 17 spy agencies. The people who have left were responsible for collecting and analyzing the intelligence that goes into the president's daily briefing. Their work also included monitoring a broad array of subjects including the Islamic State, Russian and North Korean hackers, and analyzing the intentions of foreign governments, and they were responsible for protecting the classified networks that carry such sensitive information.\n",
      "\"Some synonym of the word 'epidemic' is the best way to describe it,\" said Ellison Anne Williams, a former senior researcher at the NSA who left in 2016 to start her own data-security firm, Enveil. More than 10 of her employees also came from the NSA, she said. \"The agency is losing an amazing amount of its strongest technical talent, and to lose your best and brightest staff is a huge hit.\"\n",
      "The NSA would not disclose how many job vacancies it has. Agency officials said there is a 5.6 percent attrition rate among personnel who specialize in science, technology and math. The attrition rate is closer to 8 or 9 percent among hackers and those who staff the agency's always-operating watch center monitoring for cyber attacks, a trend that has spanned the Obama and Trump administrations.\n",
      "Although the departure rates are low, compared with attrition levels in the civilian technology industry, and although the agency is filling its vacancies, most new personnel lack the experience of those who have left, said one senior intelligence official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer candid insights about the secretive organization. That experience deficit can impede the NSA's core mission of collecting and analyzing the masses of data the agency lifts from foreign networks.\n",
      "Some groups within the NSA have lost almost half of their staffs, one former official said. As a result, projects to make intelligence collection more effective have been cut or slowed.\n",
      "It is a turbulent moment in the NSA's 65-year history. The agency continues to face public distrust after revelations, made by former contractor Edward Snowden in 2013, about the scope of its surveillance of American citizens. Morale dipped in the aftermath of those disclosures and has not fully recovered. More recently, the workforce was rattled by a series of breaches targeting the agency's highly sensitive hacking tools.\n",
      "Another source of frustration is an ongoing reorganization that has merged the NSA's highly secret electronic spying mission with its more public network-defense operation, along with other changes. NSA Director Michael S. Rogers, a Navy admiral who also oversees the military's Cyber Command, launched NSA 21 to break down what he called the \"walls of granite\" among divisions whose missions, he believed, complement one another.\n",
      "Former employees have voiced a variety of complaints. Some say they feel their missions have been marginalized by the restructuring. One called the reorganization \"an enormous distraction\" and lamented what he characterized as an inefficient procurement process that made it difficult to obtain even simple open-source developer tools. Another faulted the agency's pay structure and promotion system, saying it favors seniority over skill and competence.\n",
      "A series of breaches beginning with Snowden and including the arrest of former contractor Harold T. Martin III in 2016 have led to new security precautions. Such restrictions on accessing data have made work more difficult, and the internal hunt for would-be leakers has contributed to an environment of suspicion, said a number of current and former employees.\n",
      "\"It comes down to death by a thousand cuts,\" said a former employee, adding that people \"tend to quit in packs. One person hits their breaking point, and once they leave, the dominoes start falling.\"\n",
      "The brain drain has been so pronounced that at one gathering in 2016 of the agency's elite hacking division, one individual raised the concern with Rogers directly. According to several people familiar with the exchange, Rogers disputed that there was any increase in attrition and told his employees that they should stop complaining and get back to work.\n",
      "An NSA spokesman, Tommy Groves, did not challenge the account, saying that employees' concerns about high attrition rates have led to changes, including increased pay, increased promotions and greater opportunities to work at all NSA sites.\n",
      "Rogers did not respond to a request for comment. More recently, though, he has made it a point in public to thank the agency's workforce and acknowledge the \"cultural challenge\" its employees face. At a national security conference in September, for instance, he said that dealing with \"the great men and women of the organization\" is \"the best part of the day for me.\"\n",
      "He added: \"If the price of security becomes that we drive away the very men and women that generate value in the first place, we now have a self-induced mission kill.\"\n",
      "Rogers has told colleagues he plans to retire in the spring, ending a four-year tenure that has been rocky at times. At one point in 2016, the defense secretary and director of national intelligence wanted him removed over various leadership concerns. Rogers survived the episode, and with Trump's national security team still settling in, he was seen as an element of continuity at the agency.\n",
      "It is not clear whom President Donald Trump will nominate to succeed him, but whoever steps into the role will face a variety of challenges.\n",
      "\"NSA is at this moment experiencing stress that is constant and unrelenting,\" one former senior intelligence official said. He said the agency has weathered other high-anxiety periods \"because there was cohesion in the workforce and a leader who could nurture them through it, if not inspire them. But this director hasn't chosen to do that.\"\n",
      "Skilled personnel have always left the NSA, in particular to work for defense contractors that support its work, said Deputy Director George Barnes, who has been at the agency for 31 years. \"The big change these days is there's a supply-demand imbalance between the outside and the inside,\" he told The Washington Post.\n",

      "Inside a classroom at a community college in Dallas, about two dozen women took turns sharing their names, hometowns and what they hoped would be their future titles.\n",
      "Congresswoman. State representative. County judge.\n",
      "It was part of a training held by EMILY's List, an organization dedicated to electing women at all levels of government who support abortion rights. One of the presentation's PowerPoint slides flashed a mock advertisement on the projector screen: \"Help Wanted: Progressive Women Candidates.\"\n",
      "A record number of women appear to be answering that call, fueled largely by frustration on the Democratic side over the election of President Donald Trump and energized by Democratic women winning races in Virginia in November. Experts say 2018 is on track to be a historic year, with more women saying they are running at this point than ever before.\n",
      "\"I've never seen anything like this,\" said Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY's List. \"Every day, dozens more women come to our website, come to our Facebook page and say, 'I am mad as hell. I want to do something about it. What should I do now?'\"\n",
      "In the four weeks after the 2016 election, 1,000 women came to the group's website to learn about running for office. That number has now surpassed 26,000. By comparison, the group was in contact with 960 women for the previous election cycle.\n",
      "Whether all that enthusiasm will result in full-fledged campaigns and translate to gains in the number of women elected to office remains to be seen.\n",
      "Although women are more than half the American population, they account for just a fifth of all U.S. representatives and senators, and one in four state lawmakers. They serve as governors of only six states and mayors in roughly 20 percent of the nation's most populous cities.\n",
      "For Sarah Riggs Amico, the executive chairwoman of a major auto hauling company, last year's Women's March in Atlanta ignited her interest in running for office.\n",
      "\"It was something that really lifted me up and made me want to demand better from my government,\" said Amico, who recently announced plans to run for lieutenant governor in Georgia.\n",
      "Sol Flores has been walking in marches with her mother in Chicago since she was a little girl, but never thought she would run for office. Now 44, Flores said she was enraged by policies put forward by the Trump administration and decided to jump into a crowded Democratic primary for Illinois' 4th Congressional District.\n",
      "Flores said her network of friends has been crucial to helping her navigate the realities of being a first-time candidate and the challenges of gathering signatures for qualifying and fundraising.\n",
      "\"Women are really good at this, saying, 'Let's sit down and figure this out. You raised your hand, and let's win. Let's go to Washington, D.C.,'\" said Flores, the executive director of a nonprofit helping homeless families and at-risk youths.\n",
      "The last time the U.S. saw a surge in women running for office was 1992, in the wake of Anita Hill's testimony before an all-male U.S. Senate committee weighing the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court. It was called the \"Year of the Woman\" because women were elected to the U.S. House and Senate in record numbers.\n",
      "The number of women in office has held steady in recent years, but experts say conditions are ripe for an increase in 2018 — especially if more politicians are forced to step down or retire amid the growing #MeToo movement that began with accusations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood mega-producer Harvey Weinstein.\n",
      "One U.S. senator and four congressmen have so far announced plans to retire or not seek re-election following allegations against them, presenting a prime opportunity for women to compete for their open seats. For example, seven women have expressed interest in an April special election for an Arizona congressional seat.\n",
      "The increase in women candidates is largely being seen in U.S. House and governor's races next year and driven primarily by Democrats, said Debbie Walsh, who leads the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. In addition to the 50 Democratic and 10 Republican congresswomen expected to run for re-election, there are 183 Democratic women and 14 Republican women running in primaries to challenge their current U.S. representative.\n",
      "These can be uphill races, but many of the women running say they were encouraged by what happened in Virginia in November, when 30 percent of the women who challenged their state representative won.\n",
      "Katie Hill is among those seeking to oust her local congressman, Republican Rep. Steve Knight in California's 25th Congressional District, a key Democratic target this year.\n",
      "As an advocate for the homeless, Hill recalled the joy she felt on the night of the 2016 election when voters in Los Angeles passed a $1.2 billion bond measure for housing and services for homeless people and those at risk of becoming homeless. But that was quickly tempered by the outcome of the presidential election.\n",
      "\"November made us all realize that our country is not where we need to be,\" Hill said. \"And that's the point when people start to stand up and say, 'If no one else is going to fix, I'm going to.'\"\n",
      "It's not just Democrats. First-time Republican and Libertarian women candidates are also jumping into the mix.\n",
      "Republicans launched an effort in 2012 that is focused on electing women. Under the \"Right Women, Right Now\" program, 390 new GOP women have been elected since then.\n",
      "\"Twenty-five percent of state legislators are women, and that's clearly insufficient,\" said Matt Walter, head of the Republican State Leadership Committee. \"That's a Democratic and Republican number, and something we really felt strongly was something we needed to change.\"\n",

      "In 1994, only 16 percent of Democrats had a “very unfavorable” view of the G.O.P. Now, 38 percent do. Then, only 17 percent of Republicans had a “very unfavorable” view of Democrats. Now, 43 percent do. When the Pew Research Center asked Democrats and Republicans to talk about each other, they tended to use the same words: closed-minded, dishonest, immoral, lazy, unintelligent.\n",
      "Furthermore, it won’t be easy to go back to the common-humanity form of politics. King was operating when there was high social trust. He could draw on a biblical metaphysic debated over 3,000 years. He could draw on an American civil religion that had been refined over 300 years.\n",
      "Over the past two generations, however, excessive individualism and bad schooling have corroded both of those sources of cohesion.\n",
      "In 1995, the French intellectual Pascal Bruckner published “The Temptation of Innocence,” in which he argued that excessive individualism paradoxically leads to in-group/out-group tribalism. Modern individualism releases each person from social obligation, but “being guided only by the lantern of his own understanding, the individual loses all assurance of a place, an order, a definition. He may have gained freedom, but he has lost security.”\n",
      "In societies like ours, individuals are responsible for their own identity, happiness and success. “Everyone must sell himself as a person in order to be accepted,” Bruckner wrote. We all are constantly comparing ourselves to others and, of course, coming up short. The biggest anxiety is moral. We each have to write our own gospel that defines our own virtue.\n",
      "Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n",
      "The easiest way to do that is to tell a tribal oppressor/oppressed story and build your own innocence on your status as victim. Just about everybody can find a personal victim story. Once you’ve identified your herd’s oppressor — the neoliberal order, the media elite, white males, whatever — your goodness is secure. You have virtue without obligation. Nothing is your fault.\n",
      "“What is moral order today? Not so much the reign of right-thinking people as that of right-suffering, the cult of everyday despair,” Bruckner continued. “I suffer, therefore I am worthy. … Suffering is analogous to baptism, a dubbing that inducts us into the order of a higher humanity, hoisting us above our peers.”\n",
      "Haidt and Bruckner are very different writers, with different philosophies. But they both point to the fact that we’ve regressed from a sophisticated moral ethos to a primitive one. The crooked timber school of humanity says the line between good and evil runs through each person and we fight injustice on the basis of our common humanity. The oppressor/oppressed morality says the line runs between tribes. That makes it easy to feel good about yourself. But it makes you very hard to live with.\n",

      "As the NHS struggles with budget cuts, soaring demand and staff shortages, almost £1bn is being wasted annually by patients missing appointments, figures reveal.\n",

      "“With the NHS coming under pressure as never before, we are asking patients and the public to use the health service responsibly to help ensure that care is readily available for everyone who needs it,” she said.\n",
      "“There are now more doctors, nurses and other clinicians available at the end of a phone to give advice and guidance to users of the 111 service.”\n",
