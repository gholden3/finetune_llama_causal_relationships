The dog bit me! Get the dog!’”\\nRex, sensing there was danger in the house, ran downstairs to confront the burglars—who ruthlessly beat him.\\nAs the burglars continued to pilfer through the house, they approached the room where the teen was hiding. Although Rex had little strength left in him, he pounced on the burglars.\\n“I think if it wasn’t for him, I probably wouldn’t be standing here today,” Mercado said.\\nThe hero German Shepherd was shot three times trying to take down the burglars.\\nOnce the burglars heard police sirens, they fled the scene. When the officers arrived at the home, they rushed Rex to a local veterinarian, expecting the worst because they thought the animal was dead.\\nDoctors gave the dog pain medication, wound care, and antibiotics while placing him in intensive care. The German Shepherd is now recovering and in stable condition.\\nA family member set up a GoFundMe page to raise money to pay for Rex’s veterinary bills. The page raised $58,161 as of Sunday afternoon—more than five times the page’s $10,000 goal.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

And it happened as President Donald Trump tested out new midterm material – even accusing Democrats of “treason” for not applauding during his State of the Union address.\\nThe president is clearly ready for midterm politics. But as the split-screen of a market freefall and presidential attacks showed, the political landscape may not be ready for him – not with signs of economic uncertainty, and standoffs and showdowns dominating headlines.\\nThere is obvious political risk in running on a booming stock market, since it makes it harder not to own a slide.

Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo\\nChildhood obesity programmes in schools are not the answer to the epidemic affecting the UK, according to researchers who say much wider local and national action is needed, including curbs on the advertising of junk food.\\nA major obesity programme introduced into more than 50 primary schools in the West Midlands has failed to have any significant effect on children’s weight. Children were given a year of extra physical activity sessions, a healthy eating programme and cookery workshops with their parents. Families were invited to activity events, including sessions run by Aston Villa football club.\\nBut at the end of 30 months, there was no difference in obesity between those children who took part and those who did not.\\nThe government’s childhood obesity plan, launched from Downing Street in January last year, placed great emphasis on increasing sport and other activity in schools. A number of school-based obesity programmes have been introduced around the country, focusing on increasing physical activity and improving children’s diet in school.\\nBut, says the team from the University of Birmingham’s Institute of Applied Health Research, the negative results from their large study published in the British Medical Journal are in line with what has been found elsewhere; schools may have a role to play but can only be part of the answer to the obesity problem.\\n“We need to look at ways that we can really engage communities in this agenda, change our local environment and look at how national policies can support diet and physical activity,” said Miranda Pallan, one of the team.\\nChildren, she said “are at the centre of lots of layers of influence”. For primary school children, parents and the wider family are key. “They function within their family. Decisions on what to eat and what they do are determined by their family.”\\nAdults, who may themselves be obese, are influenced by many different things. Local initiatives in communities can help but national policies on food and the environment are also vital.\\nThe government is tackling sugar levels in soft drinks and foods. “There are some good things in the government’s plan but we would argue that there need to be further measures and there are things like advertising restrictions that would be very good to see,” Pallan said.\\n“If anything what our research highlights is that although schools are vitally important, they can’t do it alone. We need many, many approaches. Each of those will make a marginal difference. We need to look at the whole picture of the causes and tackle each of those areas.”\\nThe institute created and introduced an ambitious programme called West Midlands ActiVe lifestyle and healthy Eating in School children, dubbed Waves. The programme included extra daily physical activity in schools, a physical activity and healthy eating programme in conjunction with local sporting heroes, regular information to parents about local physical activity opportunities, and workshops on healthy cooking for families at schools.\\nAbout 1,400 children aged six and seven took part in the trial. At the start of the trial, height and weight was recorded for each of them, along with other measurements relating to body fat, diet and physical activity levels.\\nThe researchers found no significant difference in weight status and no meaningful effect on body fat measurements, diet or physical activity levels at 15 and 30 months in children taking part in the programme, compared with those not taking part.\\nThey suggest that “nudge” interventions, such as using financial incentives to prompt healthier behaviour, merit further investigation. But they conclude that school based motivational, educational approaches “are unlikely to halt the childhood obesity epidemic.”\\nProf Melissa Wake, paediatrician and obesity expert from Victoria, Australia, says in a linked editorial that it is time to step back and take stock. The important findings of the trial “could perhaps help break the cycle of policymakers continuing with ineffective educational preventive approaches that can never hope to greatly impact on the obesity epidemic.”\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

What followed surprised some officials there: Almost no one used the law. For years, it was relegated to the back shelf of law enforcement, with only a handful of cases a year.\\nThe pace of cases began to quicken, Connecticut statistics show, after high-profile shootings occurred elsewhere, starting in 2007 with the deaths of 33 people on the campus of Virginia Tech. Advocates of red flag laws said they provided important protections, particularly as people became increasingly aware of the risks of mass shootings.\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nStill, even states with the laws have not avoided such shootings. The gunman who killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012 had access to guns, though people who knew him said he had shown troubling signs before the attack.\\n“This is a country with hundreds of millions of guns in circulation, and that fact imposes real constraints on what policy can achieve and on what kind of policy makes sense,” said Ramesh Ponnuru, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group. No one, Mr. Ponnuru added, should expect any one law to fix everything. “Realism is the right attitude,” he said.\\nMany Republicans oppose red flag laws, and the National Rifle Association has argued that a judge’s order to seize a person’s weapon may violate Second Amendment rights when no crime has been committed.\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you\\'re not a robot by clicking the box.

The removals are temporary, these officials stress, meaning that guns are returned to people no longer deemed dangerous.\\nThe laws allow weapons to be seized for a brief time — typically two or three weeks — after which a petitioner, usually a police agency, must go back to court to let a judge decide whether the gun owner’s behavior amounts to a threat to himself or others and whether the weapons should be held longer. Some states, including New York and Texas, already allow guns to be taken from mental health patients deemed dangerous, but red flag laws hinge on outward behavior — a person’s statements and actions regardless of medical diagnosis.\\n“The reason I like gun violence restraining orders as an option is that we can use them even if the person hasn’t been convicted of a crime,” said Mara W. Elliott, the San Diego city attorney. California’s measure, patterned after Connecticut’s, took effect in 2016, and late last year, Ms. Elliott assigned an assistant city attorney to pursue gun seizure cases full time, one of the first cities in the nation to take such aggressive action.\\nSo far, the office has pursued 10 cases, Ms. Elliott said, and officials there have seen circumstances involving more intimate situations than they had expected. Prompted by calls to the police, who then asked the city attorney to intervene under the new law, the authorities removed guns from Alzheimer’s patients, alcoholics and people accused of domestic abuse.\\nSince Connecticut passed its law, the state has seen 1,519 cases, about two-thirds of them since 2012. California’s far newer law resulted in 86 cases in its first year. And Washington’s superior courts have held about 65 hearings under the law since it was approved by voters in 2016.\\nRed flag laws have evolved, too. Connecticut and Indiana, which passed its law in 2005 after the murder of an Indianapolis police officer, allow only law enforcement agencies to bring petitions for temporary gun removal. Newer measures, in California, Oregon and Washington, allow family members to bring such petitions to judges as well.\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nThe effectiveness of the statutes has depended on the level of communication between the public and law enforcement agencies, according to social and health policy researchers who have studied the laws. In some places, they said, residents have been far more willing to report troubling behavior than in others. And in some communities, law enforcement agencies are more familiar with the technical intricacies of applying the red flag laws than they are in others. Even in the states that have had the laws longer, like Indiana, state officials have said that many residents and police officers are unaware of the tools they have.\\nCurtis T. Hill Jr., the Republican attorney general of Indiana, on Wednesday took the unusual step of reminding his colleagues around the state that the provision exists.\\n“Indiana’s ‘Red Flag Law’ is a common-sense measure that in no way inhibits the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens,” Mr. Hill said in a statement. “This useful provision is not as well-known, even among law enforcement, as one might expect. That’s why this week we are distributing a public safety advisory raising awareness of the law and urging police and prosecutors to make full use of it as we work together to protect all Hoosiers.”\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

However, his comments were the most positive from any U.S. official since Trump abruptly canceled the meeting last week after belligerent statements from the North.\\nThe two countries, eying the first summit between the U.S. and the North after six decades of hostility, have also been holding negotiations in Singapore and the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.\\nEarly Thursday, Trump told reporters \"we are doing very well\" with North Korea. He added there may even need to be a second or third summit meeting to reach a deal on North Korean denuclearization but still hedged, saying \"maybe we\\'ll have none.\"\\nKim Yong Chol is the highest-ranking North Korean official to visit the U.S. in 18 years, and his trip to the White House will be a highly symbolic sign of easing tensions after fears of war escalated amid North Korean nuclear and missile tests last year.\\nPompeo, the former CIA chief who has traveled to North Korea and met with Kim Jong Un twice in the past two months, said he believed the country\\'s leaders are \"contemplating a path forward where they can make a strategic shift, one that their country has not been prepared to make before.\"\\nHe tweeted from New York: \"Good progress today during our meetings\" with Kim and his team. Yet he also said at his news conference that difficult work remains including hurdles that may appear to be insurmountable as negotiations progress on the U.S. demand for North Korea\\'s complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization.\\n\"We will push forward to test the proposition that we can achieve that outcome,\" he said.\\nPompeo spoke after meeting with Kim Yong Chol for a little more than two hours at the residence of the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. The talks had been expected to be held in two sessions, one in the morning and one in the early afternoon, and had not been expected to conclude until 1:30 p.m. Instead, the two men wrapped up at 11:25 a.m.\\nPompeo said they finished everything they needed to address in the morning session. Immediately afterward, he tweeted that he had had substantive talks on the priorities for the potential summit. Pompeo was accompanied by Andrew Kim, the head of a CIA unit assigned to work on North Korea, and Mark Lambert, the head of the State Department\\'s Korea desk.\\n\"Our secretary of state is having very good meetings,\" Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews before departing on a trip to Texas. He said of the North Koreans, \"I believe they will be coming down to Washington on Friday. A letter being delivered to me from Kim Jong Un. It is very important to them.\"\\n\"It is all a process,\" he said of arranging the summit. \"Hopefully we will have a meeting on the 12th.\"\\nDespite the upbeat messaging in the United States, Kim Jong Un, in a meeting with Russia\\'s foreign minister on Thursday, complained about the U.S. trying to spread its influence in the region, a comment that may complicate the summit plans. \"As we move to adjust to the political situation in the face of U.S. hegemonism, I am willing to exchange detailed and in-depth opinions with your leadership and hope to do so moving forward,\" Kim told Sergey Lavrov.\\nNorth Korea\\'s flurry of diplomatic activity following an increase in nuclear weapons and missile tests in 2017 suggests that Kim is eager for sanctions relief to build his economy and for the international legitimacy a summit with Trump would provide. But there are lingering doubts on whether he will ever fully relinquish his nuclear arsenal, which he may see as his only guarantee of survival in a region surrounded by enemies.\\nTrump views a summit as a legacy-defining opportunity to make a nuclear deal, but he has left the world guessing since canceling the meeting last week in an open letter to Kim that complained of the North\\'s \"tremendous anger and open hostility.\" North Korea\\'s conciliatory response to that letter appears to have put the summit back on track.\\nKim Yong Chol is the most senior North Korean visitor to the United States since Vice Marshal Jo Myong Rok visited Washington in 2000 to meet President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. That was the last time the two sides, which are technically at war, attempted to arrange a leadership summit. It was an effort that ultimately failed as Clinton\\'s time in office ran out, and relations turned sour again after George W. Bush took office in early 2001 with a tough policy on the North.\\nKim Yong Chol, vice chairman of the North Korean ruling party\\'s central committee, was allowed into the United States despite being on a U.S. sanctions list, and North Korean officials are not normally allowed to travel outside the New York area.\\nThe North Korean mission at the United Nations did not respond to an email seeking comment Thursday, and phone calls were not answered.\\n———\\nLederman reported from Washington.

All of the things that have failed us, all of the systems that have failed us,” she said on “Fox News Sunday.” “I also believe we need to make it harder for people to access guns when they are not mentally stable, when they are young, when they are not in a place where they should be owning a weapon like this.”\\nSeventeen people were killed in the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland by alleged teen gunman, Nikolas Cruz, who used an AR-15 and who had a history of emotional problems, according to investigators.\\nOne of the victims’ fathers, Andrew Pollack, whose daughter, Meadow, died in the shooting, spoke about the need to make change now: “The new norm has to be our kids are safe in the school. This can’t happen again, I can’t let it happen to another kid in another state.”\\nHe told Fox News' Chris Wallace: “I want to tell every governor in every other state, they need to be proactive right now. They need to get a bill in place and we’re going to put all America together, work with these governors to protect our schools. We can’t have another shooting in this country. I can’t live with it. This has to stop with Parkland, and my daughter’s death can’t be in vain. It has to be the last one.”\\nCruz was arrested and charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder.\\nPollack said that he has been making his grief actionable. “It’s rough, I have my moments you know. It’s like a wave of emotions,” he said about the fire that drives him now. “I can’t explain it, I could walk through flames right now, there’s nothing I can’t do.”\\nTarr has been one of the most vocal advocates for change since the shooting, but she knows first and foremost she’s a student.\\n“It’s very daunting to imagine going back to a place that just two weeks prior held such horrors, and it’s scary because I don’t know if I am going to be safe there, but I know that I have to,” she said about returning to school. “I know now more than ever I’m proud of who I am, and I feel like I need that sense of normalcy because it’s, like, I can’t even be a high schooler anymore.”\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

The video, which has been widely circulated on social media seems to have poured fuel on the protests.\\nOrtega has been in office since 2007. This is his fourth term as president, and the protests are widely seen as his biggest challenge yet.\\nBut in remarks Saturday, Ortega seemed to further enrage Nicaraguans by saying the protesters were being politically manipulated; and pointed to the reforms as only being a proposal, and that he was open to negotiations with the business community.\\nThe business community however, which is widely seen as an ally to the government, released a statement saying it would not sit down until freedom is speech is restored and police violence stops.\\nThe BBC reports that independent TV stations have been taken off the air after broadcasting the protests live.\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption INTI OCON/AFP/Getty Images INTI OCON/AFP/Getty Images\\nIn Managua, protesters are reportedly looting dozens of businesses and have also toppled a tree of life sculpture that was erected as part of the First Lady and Vice President Rosario Murillo\\'s beautification initiative.

A lack of “presidential temperament,” according to Mr. Tobin, does not preclude Mr. Trump from “making decisions and often getting them right.” The 25th Amendment, he adds, “was intended to provide for a replacement when a president couldn’t serve, not to dump a man whose behavior offends the sensibilities of the educated class.” Read more »\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n_____\\nDavid Frum in The Atlantic:\\n“Trump may imagine that he’s Michael Corleone, the tough and canny rightful heir — or even Sonny Corleone, the terrifyingly violent but at least powerful heir apparent — but after today he is Fredo forever.”\\nWhatever Mr. Trump’s flaws and cognitive deficiencies may be, Mr. Frum contends, his “genius” is undeniable in one particular way: He “understands how to mobilize hatred and resentment to his own advantage and profit.” Mr. Frum suggests that instead of focusing on the president’s mental health, we turn our attention to the people and institutions that keep such a president in power — despite knowing better.

It yielded little result but the cancellation of a planned news conference of EU leaders on Thursday.\\nThe final joint text, adopted on Friday, hinges on “voluntary” actions on migration from EU states.\\nConte at first claimed it represented a victory, but softened his tone after League leader Matteo Salvini showed caution.\\nAt a news conference on Friday after the two-day EU summit, he toughened it again, telling reporters he had “bullied” his peers into the migration deal. He appeared to have very different views from his German and French partners on what it meant.\\nImages from the long night of talks showed Conte working closely with France’s President Emmanuel Macron, with whom he reached a preliminary compromise on new centers to handle migrants’ asylum requests in willing EU countries.\\nBut in his public statements, Conte tried to distance himself from the French president, who is in constant conflict with Italy’s Home Affairs Minister Salvini.\\nThe Italian prime minister disputed Macron’s statements that France would be exempt from hosting migrant centers. “Macron was tired.

It was one of history’s miracles: a continent ravaged by dictatorship, genocide and war transformed itself into a model of democracy and broadly shared prosperity.\\nIndeed, by the early years of this century Europeans were in many ways better off than Americans. Unlike us, they had guaranteed health care, which went along with higher life expectancy; they had much lower rates of poverty; they were actually more likely than we were to be gainfully employed during their prime working years.\\nBut now Europe is in big trouble. So, of course, are we. In particular, while democracy is under siege on both sides of the Atlantic, the collapse of freedom, if it comes, will probably happen here first. But it’s worth taking a break from our own Trumpian nightmare to look at Europe’s woes, some but not all of which parallel ours.\\nMany of Europe’s problems come from the disastrous decision, a generation ago, to adopt a single currency. The creation of the euro led to a temporary wave of euphoria, with vast amounts of money flowing into nations like Spain and Greece; then the bubble burst. And while countries like Iceland that retained their own money were able to quickly regain competitiveness by devaluing their currencies, eurozone nations were forced into a protracted depression, with extremely high unemployment, as they struggled to get their costs down.\\n\\n### Response:\\n######\\n1.

The steak would be for the black eye he has suffered in this corruption case, now in the jury’s hands.\\nNothing in this tawdry affair works to his benefit. If Mr. Percoco, the governor’s former aide and family friend, is convicted of charges that he took gobs of bribe money — ziti, in his “Sopranos”-inflected argot — it will reflect poorly on Mr. Cuomo. But even if the verdict is not guilty, the ethical pall over Albany and its chief executive will not be dispelled. Bribery described as pasta has a way of sticking in people’s heads. “This is not how honest and honorable public servants talk,” a federal prosecutor, David Zhou, correctly noted to the jurors on Tuesday.\\nEven without government allegations of wrongdoing by Mr. Cuomo, he doesn’t quite hit all the right ethical notes. In this regard, he is not alone.\\nHis political nemesis, Mayor Bill de Blasio, is destined to be haunted by one Harendra Singh, a restaurant owner who, it was recently reported, secretly pleaded guilty to bribing Mr. de Blasio in return for help getting favorable lease terms. No charges were brought against the mayor or his aides. Federal prosecutors noted last year that making a case would have been difficult, presumably because the United States Supreme Court had raised the bar for proving political corruption months before Mr. Singh’s plea in 2016.\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

He’s accused of taking Singh bribes. Mr. Mangano’s lawyers have left little doubt that they will make Mr. Singh’s de Blasio connection — and the absence of any charges against the mayor — part of a strategy to discredit him as a prosecution witness.\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nFor Mr. Cuomo, who’s up for re-election this year, discomfiting proximity to criminal cases does not end with the Percoco trial.

They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”\\nSince then, the U.S. president has threatened to blow up or renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has insisted Mexico will pay for a border wall between the two countries.\\nThe battle over the wall has come to dominate the U.S.-Mexico relationship, despite decades of closer trade and security ties. Trump’s fierce criticism of the U.S. neighbor has left Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto exposed at home, and former Mexican President Vicente Fox Quesada fuming:\\nHello, @realDonaldTrump, it\\'s me with a small reminder for you: We\\'re still NOT paying for your #FuckingWall. https://t.co/RDlaifwPr1 — Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) June 7, 2017\\n.@realDonaldTrump, your mouth is the foulest shithole in the world. With what authority do you proclaim who’s welcome in America and who’s not. America’s greatness is built on diversity, or have you forgotten your immigrant background, Donald? — Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) January 11, 2018\\nA Bad Start With Australia\\nTrump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull have a seemingly friendly relationship in public, but it wasn’t always that way.\\nTurnbull and Trump’s infamous first phone call made for a shaky start. The president accused the Five Eyes ally of trying to send the “next Boston bombers” via a refugee swap deal, prompting Turnbull to confront him over the deal’s importance. Scheduled for an hour, the phone call reportedly lasted just 25 minutes. Trump eventually agreed to the deal.\\nSince then, the pair appear to have warmed to each other, sharing dinner and drinks on the USS Intrepid in New York City. Turnbull recently praised Trump’s rhetoric on North Korea, telling an Australian radio station it was ratcheting up pressure on the rogue nation.\\n“They cannot be rewarded for their rogue status and reckless conduct,” Turnbull said.\\n‘The Wrong Thing To Do’ In Britain\\nThe “special relationship” between the U.S. and the United Kingdom entered a new phase with Trump’s election: awkwardness. British Prime Minister Theresa May was the first foreign leader to visit Trump, a signal of the security and trade partnerships the two countries have shared since World War II.\\nBut May quickly faced pressure to change her tone, particularly after intelligence surrounding the Manchester terror attack was seemingly leaked in the U.S.\\nThe awkwardness came to a head in early January this year, when Trump retweeted several videos from the far-right Britain First party. May called the retweets “wrong,” while several other British MPs described Trump as “fascist” and “stupid.”\\nUK Prime Minister Theresa May tells Donald Trump \"retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do\" https://t.co/eXclqvhbbp pic.twitter.com/bdGUMRaWHl — BBC Breaking News (@BBCBreaking) November 30, 2017\\nAn Altered Relationship With Germany\\nUnder Trump, U.S. relations with Germany have been strained and unsettled by Trump’s controversial policy decisions, like pulling out of the Paris climate accord, and his direct criticism of German policies and its leaders.\\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said earlier this year that Berlin may not be able to rely on the U.S. in the future, and she urged Europe to take its fate into its own hands.\\n“Germany can no longer simply react to U.S. policy but must establish its own position,” Germany’s top diplomat, Sigmar Gabriel, warned policymakers at the end of last year.\\n“Even after Trump leaves the White House, relations with the U.S. will never be the same,” he added.\\nTrump has yet to appoint an ambassador to Germany.\\nMerkel asks for a handshake during White House photo op, Trump doesn\\'t respond. #Awkward\\nRead more: https://t.co/PLwqJp7kQd pic.twitter.com/IRZZvMKoSs — euronews (@euronews) March 18, 2017\\nWorrying NATO Allies\\nTrump used the 68-year-old North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a punching bag in the lead-up to the election, blasting the alliance as “obsolete” and calling out members like Germany for not paying their fair share.\\nHe continued the practice throughout the first year of his presidency. During a speech in Brussels last May, the president refused to affirm his commitment to Article 5 of the treaty — which holds that an attack against one alliance member is considered an attack against all members. (Trump later did affirm his commitment to the article.)\\nBut the future for the alliance isn’t entirely bleak. The number of U.S. personnel being deployed in Europe has gone up, Slovakia’s former ambassador to NATO, Tomas Valasek, told NPR. The real question is how Trump will respond when an ally is attacked.\\n“The honest answer is none of us quite knows,” Valasek said.\\nInsulting Haiti And African Countries\\nTrump opened 2018 by offending some of America’s key allies in Africa. After he reportedly referred to nations in Africa, as well as Haiti, as “shithole countries,” the presidents of Ghana and Senegal made their displeasure known.\\n“We will not accept such insults, even from a leader of a friendly country, no matter how powerful,” said Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo. Ghana has close ties to the United States.\\nSenegalese President Macky Sall also expressed his shock over the remarks.“I reject them and condemn vigorously. Africa and the black race deserve the respect and consideration of all,” Sall said.\\nJe suis choqué par les propos du Président Trump sur Haïti et sur l\\'Afrique.

Chad, another majority Muslim nation, was removed from the list in April.\\nAlthough several federal courts had blocked the ban nationwide, the justices allowed the policy to take full effect in December pending consideration of the merits of the case. The temporary order allowing full implementation was an ominous sign for opponents of the Trump policy, particularly since only two justices—liberals Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor— dissented.\\nThe ruling on Tuesday reverses the lower court decisions and will allow the policy to remain in place indefinitely.\\n“The Proclamation is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority. “The text says nothing about religion.“\\nCecillia Wang, deputy legal director with the American Civil Liberties Union, said the decision marked “a dreadful day” for the United States. “But we Americans will fight on to express the will of the people to uphold equality and freedom,” she tweeted.\\nPrior to the ruling, court-watchers speculated that Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court’s frequent swing vote, might struggle to reconcile the objections to anti-religious bias that he stated in his Masterpiece Cakeshop decision earlier this month with a vote for the Trump administration in the travel ban case.\\nIn Masterpiece Cakeshop, Kennedy upheld a baker\\'s religious-based refusal to sell a cake for a gay wedding on the grounds that a state civil rights commission that ruled against the baker showed “hostility” to the baker’s religious beliefs. In the travel ban case, however, Kennedy apparently set aside concerns about anti-religious bias in deference to the executive branch\\'s prerogatives concerning national security.\\nThe new high court decision marks the conclusion of a protracted legal fight over the travel ban, which critics argue stems from Trump’s discriminatory attitude toward Muslims.\\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

As administration lawyers sought to portray the policy as well within presidential authority and unrelated to Trump\\'s campaign vows, Trump often undermined those arguments.\\nLast June, he expressed regret about altering the original policy, complaining that his lawyers were pushing a \"watered down, politically correct version.\"\\nIn September, Trump again suggested that he was unsatisfied with his own policy. \"The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!\" he wrote.\\nJudges reviewing Trump\\'s policy also seized on his retweeting of anti-Muslim videos from Britain and another message broadcasting an apocryphal story about a U.S. general ordering Muslim radicals shot with bullets dipped in pigs\\' blood.\\nTrump wasted little time in office before he signed the first travel ban, which halted visas to people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for a 90-day period and suspended the refugee resettlement program for 120 days. The stated purpose of the policy was to conduct a review of security and vetting from those nations.\\nDuring the televised signing of the executive order on a Friday in late January 2017, Trump read a variation on its title, “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,” and added, “We all know what that means.”\\nWithin hours, the policy prompted confusion and distress in airports worldwide — an immediate demonstration of Trump’s disruptive approach to governance and opposition to immigration.\\nTop administration officials didn’t receive a copy of the order until two hours after the televised signing, according to an inspector general’s report released roughly a year later.\\nThe hasty rollout left U.S. Customs and Border Protection — the agency tasked with implementing the policy — scrambling to figure out which travelers should be barred entry to the U.S. and how to handle green card holders.\\nPowerful lobbying forces — including major universities, technology companies and tourism-related businesses — mobilized against the ban, and opponents won a series of legal rulings halting the policy. Trump vowed to take the issue directly to the Supreme Court, but the administration eventually opted to rescind the original policy and issue a replacement in March of that year.\\nThe second version of the travel ban dropped Iraq from the list, which spared further embarrassment for a government working closely with American troops to fight ISIS.\\nIn addition, the reworked policy stated that people with green cards and existing visas would not be subject to the 90-day travel pause. The revised order also removed a provision that may have benefited Christian refugees in majority-Muslim nations.\\nStill, federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland blocked the policy before it could take effect, ruling that the ban amounted to unconstitutional discrimination against Muslims.\\nThe Trump administration failed to convince federal appeals courts to reverse the decision, eventually elevating the matter to the Supreme Court. In June 2017, the justices issued a short-term compromise ruling that permitted Trump to implement his policy, but exempted would-be immigrants and travelers with \"bona fide\" U.S. ties.\\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration proceeded with a security review of the six nations and refugee program.\\nWhen the review of the countries concluded in September, the ban morphed into its third and current iteration, a mix of travel restrictions against citizens of eight countries. In an apparent bid to undermine claims that the policy was aimed at Muslims, Trump added to the mix limits on travelers from Venezuela and North Korea. The latest version of the ban includes provisions for people from all affected nations to apply for waivers to enter the U.S., but immigration attorneys have claimed their clients aren’t being approved.\\nEven as the legal fight over three separate travel bans played out in court, the Trump administration appeared to achieve its goal of reducing the flow of travelers from those countries.\\nThe number of non-immigrant visas issued to people from six majority-Muslim travel ban countries fell sharply over a one-year period that began in March 2017.\\nA POLITICO analysis found that over the same period, non-immigrant visas to the world’s 50 Muslim-majority countries dropped 19 percent when compared to levels in fiscal year 2016.\\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the day the Supreme Court handed down the decision.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Nielsen, announced Friday the termination of the program that has protected about 57,000 Hondurans from deportation since 1999.\\nThat designation, known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, came in response to the deadly Hurricane Mitch in 1998, which killed an estimated 10,000 people in Honduras and launched a regional humanitarian crisis.\\nTPS was created by Congress 1990 to help people from societies wracked by civil conflict or natural disasters.\\nIn a DHS statement, Nielsen said that she is delaying the effective date for termination of TPS for Hondurans for 18 months, until January 5, 2020.\\n\"...the Secretary determined that the disruption of living conditions in Honduras from Hurricane Mitch that served as the basis for its TPS designation has decreased to a degree that it should no longer be regarded as substantial. Thus, as required under the applicable statute, the current TPS designation must be terminated.\"\\nThe announcement follows similar decisions by Nielsen to end TPS for almost 200,000 Salvadorans, 50,000 Haitians and 9,000 Nepalis. Smaller numbers of Nicaraguans and Sudanese have also lost TPS under the Trump administration. All of these immigrant groups were given more than a year to leave.\\nIn light of those announcements, immigration advocates were prepared for Nielsen\\'s decision about Hondurans, which they criticized as politically driven and without regard for the actual dangerous conditions in Honduras.\\nAccording to a statement by the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc., or CLINIC, the Central American country is in the middle of a humanitarian crisis with a \"staggering\" homicide rate, lack of safe drinking for hundreds of thousands of people and chronic childhood hunger.\\n\"The administration has attempted to paint a picture that it has no choice but to terminate TPS,\" said CLINIC executive director Jeanne Atkinson.\\n\"Its action seems to suggest that all of the past Republican and Democratic administrations that extended TPS for Honduras have not properly applied the law. To the contrary, it is the Trump administration\\'s action that disregards the law and the intent of Congress in creating TPS in the first place to safeguard human lives,\" said Atkinson.\\nBut supporters of the Trump administration praised the announcement.\\n\"The hurricane that justified it in the first place was two decades ago,\" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the D.C.-based Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates immigration limits. \"At some point, temporary needs to mean temporary.\"\\nHowever, Krikorian said, he would have preferred that the Trump administration gave Hondurans only six months to arrange to leave and not eighteen months.\\n\"It [TPS] has to stop somewhere and somebody is going to be inconvenienced by this,\" he added.\\nBut Miami business owner Orlando Lopez calls the decision a \"disaster\" for him and his family. He\\'s 55, has a small trucking company with ten employees and he supports his family back in Honduras.\\nIn an interview with NPR, Lopez said Americans don\\'t understand how difficult life is in Honduras.\\n\"I\\'m afraid to return. It\\'s a matter of life or death, \" said Lopez.\\n\"Here, I have a business. I pay taxes. I have a clean record. I will have to leave it in God\\'s hands,\" he added.\\nThe government of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said that the decision to end TPS was a sovereign issue for Washington, adding that \"we deeply lament it.\"\\nAccording to the Associated Press, an ex-Honduran ambassador to the U.S. and former Central Bank president Hugo Noe said the decision will create uncertainty for many families and he predicted that most Hondurans who were covered by TPS will choose to remain in the U.S. illegally rather than return home.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

He is a former newspaper reporter and current business owner. His novel can be found at www.davidpedreira.com. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\\n(CNN) One of the first weapons in space was a triple-barreled handgun designed to kill Russian bears. Cosmonauts brought it with them into orbit in case their descent module landed in a Siberian forest.\\nThose were simpler times -- at least in terms of celestial firepower. The militarization of space is in full gear today, and it isn\\'t focused on 800-pound omnivores. People may have understandably snickered at President Donald Trump\\'s call for a US \"space force,\" but the laughter masks the fact that too few are noticing the rush by world powers to develop warfighting capabilities in orbit.\\nRhetoric often outstrips reality in geopolitics, and a lot of experts say fears of a new arms race in space are overblown, but consider these recent headlines:\\n• The Pentagon told Congress this month it is studying a combatant command for space warfare to counter recent efforts by China and Russia to militarize Earth orbit.\\n• US Air Force Chief of Staff General David L. Goldfein warned last month that American forces will find themselves fighting from space \"in a matter of years.\"\\n• China tested a direct ascent anti-satellite and antiballistic missile system in February that analysts say could destroy most US satellites.\\n• Russian President Vladimir Putin boasted this month of a hypersonic glide vehicle that can be launched into space, navigate on its own into Earth\\'s atmosphere and avoid radar and antimissile defenses.\\nAll three countries, and others including North Korea and India , are testing systems such as lasers that fry or dazzle satellites, space-borne electromagnetic pulse weapons that can knock out power grids, and satellites that maneuver in orbit and target each other.\\nOf course, this isn\\'t entirely new. Concerns about weaponizing the cosmos have been around for decades, and international laws have been written to stave them off. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which laid much of the foundation for space law, prohibits weapons of mass destruction in orbit, on the moon or on other celestial bodies. But the treaty doesn\\'t directly ban conventional weapons in space, or weapons fired from Earth into space.\\nEfforts have been made to strengthen space nonproliferation laws, but none of the major powers seem to be honest brokers in the endeavor. While Russia and China blast the United States for refusing to agree to the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space resolution in the United Nations, they\\'re also actively testing anti-satellite systems and making no secret about their research and development for space weaponry.\\nAnd the US military has been flying a secretive, unmanned mini-space shuttle called the X-37B since 2010. It stays in orbit for two years at a time. The Air Force insists it isn\\'t a potential weapons platform. The Chinese and Russians are dubious.\\nSo where does this leave us? Science fiction writers like looking at things from 50,000 feet up -- or even 50,000 miles. And the view from that height is chilling.\\nCalling for an outright ban on weaponry buzzing around low or high-Earth orbit feels like tilting at windmills at this point. There\\'s too much momentum in the wrong direction. And few are talking about the even bigger issue outside of Earth\\'s gravitational embrace: the future resource mining of the moon, the asteroid belt and other parts of the solar system.\\nIt\\'s understandable, because so far there\\'s been nothing worth fighting for in deep space.

The stock is up about 11 percent this year,” Bloomberg reports.\\nThe announcement comes just days after Musk held a flamethrower party over the weekend in Hawthorne, California for customers who snapped up his $500 Boring Company flamethrower. The Boring Company sold 20,000 flamethrowers in “sold 20,000 units — or $10 million worth — in just five days,” CNBC reports.\\nRead Musk’s entire email on the layoff below:\\nAs described previously, we are conducting a comprehensive organizational restructuring across our whole company. Tesla has grown and evolved rapidly over the past several years, which has resulted in some duplication of roles and some job functions that, while they made sense in the past, are difficult to justify today.\\nAs part of this effort, and the need to reduce costs and become profitable, we have made the difficult decision to let go of approximately 9% of our colleagues across the company. These cuts were almost entirely made from our salaried population and no production associates were included, so this will not affect our ability to reach Model 3 production targets in the coming months.\\nGiven that Tesla has never made an annual profit in the almost 15 years since we have existed, profit is obviously not what motivates us. What drives us is our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable, clean energy, but we will never achieve that mission unless we eventually demonstrate that we can be sustainably profitable. That is a valid and fair criticism of Tesla’s history to date.\\nThis week, we are informing those whose roles are impacted by this action. We made these decisions by evaluating the criticality of each position, whether certain jobs could be done more efficiently and productively, and by assessing the specific skills and abilities of each individual in the company. As you know, we are also continuing to flatten our management structure to help us communicate better, eliminate bureaucracy and move faster.\\nIn addition to this company-wide restructuring, we’ve decided not to renew our residential sales agreement with Home Depot in order to focus our efforts on selling solar power in Tesla stores and online. The majority of Tesla employees working at Home Depot will be offered the opportunity to move over to Tesla retail locations.\\nI would like to thank everyone who is departing Tesla for their hard work over the years. I’m deeply grateful for your many contributions to our mission. It is very difficult to say goodbye. In order to minimize the impact, Tesla is providing significant salary and stock vesting (proportionate to length of service) to those we are letting go.\\nBuffett’s investing basics. Warren Buffett outlines the main investment principles he practices. Learn More\\nTo be clear, Tesla will still continue to hire outstanding talent in critical roles as we move forward and there is still a significant need for additional production personnel. I also want to emphasize that we are making this hard decision now so that we never have to do this again.\\nTo those who are departing, thank you for everything you’ve done for Tesla and we wish you well in your future opportunities. To those remaining, I would like to thank you in advance for the difficult job that remains ahead. We are a small company in one of the toughest and most competitive industries on Earth, where just staying alive, let alone growing, is a form of victory (Tesla and Ford remain the only American car companies who haven’t gone bankrupt). Yet, despite our tiny size, Tesla has already played a major role in moving the auto industry towards sustainable electric transport and moving the energy industry towards sustainable power generation and storage.

More than 330 people have been killed there since the bombing began on Sunday, according to reports.\\nThe deployment of two Su-57 fighter aircraft, which were filmed landing at Russia’s Khmeimim Airbase along the Mediterranean coast, would mark the latest high-tech military system that Russia has exhibited in Syria, a conflict that has already been used to demonstrate the prowess of Russian cruise missiles and combat helicopters.\\nBoth the Kremlin and the Ministry of Defence declined to comment on whether the fifth-generation Russian fighter jets, which are still in combat testing phases, had been deployed. Russian news agencies, including the respected RBC business daily, published reports on Thursday saying that sources in the Ministry of Defence had confirmed the presence of the advanced fighter jets in Syria.\\nThe military had previously announced it would begin to test the fighters in combat. They have been touted as a future rival to the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, which the US uses in patrols over Syria.\\n“We are buying Su-57 jets for test combat use. First stage state trials are over,” Yuri Borisov, the deputy minister of defence, said earlier in February.\\nUS-led forces wounded and killed dozens of Russian mercenaries and pro-Assad militiamen in early February, in a battle near the city of Deir Ezzor that saw US drones and warplanes directly target Russians fighting on the side of the government for the first time in the war.\\nRussia has regularly used the conflict as a testing ground for its latest military technology and has even credited it for an uptick in arms sales. The Su-57, the first operational Russian jet to use stealth technology, has been plagued by cost and time overruns, and analysts said there could be a business rationale behind the deployment.\\n“There is some operational merit in doing this, but there’s also a publicity element,” said Douglas Barrie, a senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, by telephone on Thursday. He noted that a successful demonstration of the plane in Syria could assuage concerns of potential buyers like the Indian government.\\nIt is still unclear whether the aircraft could play any role in day-to-day operations.\\n“We haven’t seen it fire anything. We haven’t seen it drop anything,” Barrie said.\\nRuslan Pukhov, a defence analyst and the director of the Moscow-based Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, said it could be “risky” to deploy the new jets to Syria.\\n“If I were the minister of defence, I probably wouldn’t do it,” he said. “If you lose one of these planes, it could make for big problems.

The dossier contained colorful but unverifiable information about Trump.\\nDemocrats, the FBI and the Department of Justice objected to the release of the memo.

Isikoff’s Yahoo News report, according to the memo, was “derived from information leaked by Steele himself.”\\nThe FBI and DOJ officials were able to obtain a FISA warrant to electronically target Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to Trump.\\nFormer deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe told the House Intelligence Committee in December 2017 that a surveillance warrant would not have been sought without the dossier and what it purportedly revealed, the memo stated.\\nThe dossier’s funding was not recorded in surveillance warrant requests\\nThe surveillance warrants and renewals did not mention that the dossier was paid for, at least in part, by the Democratic National Committee and the campaign for Hillary Clinton. The memo says the DOJ was aware at the time of the initial FISA application that “political actors were involved with the Steele dossier.”\\n“Neither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steele’s efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were known to senior DOJ and FBI officials,” the memo alleged.\\nInstead, according to the memo, the FISA application said Steele was working for a \"named U.S. person\" – but did not specifically include Fusion GPS, the firm behind the project, or its co-founder, Glenn Simpson.

The car was quickly recovered, but authorities did not immediately link it to Reinking.\\nReinking, described as a white man with brown hair, opened fire with an AR-15 in the Waffle House parking lot and then stormed the restaurant shortly after 3 a.m. Sunday, police say. Four people were killed and four others were injured before a quick-thinking customer wrestled the assault weapon away, preventing more bloodshed. Reinking then disappeared, police said.\\nPolice say about 20 people were in the Waffle House at the time of the shootings. They included people of different races and ethnicities, but the four people killed were minorities_three black and one Hispanic.\\nIt\\'s not clear why Reinking opened fire on restaurant patrons, though he may have \"mental issues,\" Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief Steve Anderson said earlier. He\\'s considered armed and dangerous, because he was known to have owned a handgun authorities have not recovered.\\nMeanwhile, authorities in Illinois shared past reports suggesting multiple red flags about a disturbed young man with paranoid delusions.\\nIn May 2016, Reinking told deputies from Tazewell County, Illinois, that music superstar Taylor Swift was stalking him and hacking his phone, and that his family was also involved, according to a report released Sunday.\\nReinking agreed to go to a local hospital for an evaluation after repeatedly resisting the request, the sheriff\\'s report said.\\nAnother sheriff\\'s report said Reinking barged into a community pool in Tremont, Illinois, last June, and jumped into the water wearing a pink woman\\'s coat over his underwear. Investigators believed he had an AR-15 rifle in his car trunk, but it was never displayed. No charges were filed.\\nLast July, Reinking was arrested by the U.S. Secret Service after he crossed into a restricted area near the White House and refused to leave, saying he wanted to meet President Donald Trump. Reinking was not armed at the time, but at the FBI\\'s request, state police in Illinois revoked his state firearms card and seized four guns from him, authorities said.\\nThe AR-15 used in the shootings was among the firearms seized.\\nIn August, Reinking told police he wanted to file a report about 20 to 30 people tapping into his computer and phone and people \"barking like dogs\" outside his residence, according to a report.\\n\"There\\'s certainly evidence that there\\'s some sort of mental health issues involved,\" Tazewell County Sheriff Robert Huston said. But he said deputies returned the guns to Reinking\\'s father on the promise that he would \"keep the weapons secure and out of the possession of Travis.\"\\nReinking\\'s father \"has now acknowledged giving them back\" to his son, Aaron said.\\nPhone calls to a number listed for the father, Jeffrey Reinking, went unanswered.\\nIt is not clear why Reinking moved recently from Morton, Illinois, and if it had anything to do with being near Swift, who has a home in Nashville. Police say he worked in construction for a while.\\nPolice say Reinking drove into the Waffle House parking lot in his gold Chevy Silverado pickup early Sunday and sat there for about four minutes before opening fire outside the restaurant.\\nThe victims fatally shot in the parking have been identified as Taurean Sanderlin, 29, of Goodlettsville, and Joe Perez, 20, of Nashville.\\nSanderlin was an employee at the restaurant.\\nPerez\\'s mother posted a picture of her son on Facebook and asked for prayers, saying it was the hardest day of her life. \"Me, my husband and sons are broken right now with this loss,\" Trisha Perez said in the post. \"Our lives are shattered.\"\\nReinking then entered the restaurant and opened fire, police said.\\nOne of the fatally wounded inside was DeEbony Groves, a 21-year student at Nashville\\'s Belmont University.

Photograph: HANDOUT/AFP/Getty Images\\nThe daughter of a Swedish bookseller who was seized by Chinese agents while travelling with two European diplomats has said she fears her father is facing years behind bars after police claimed he was involved in “trafficking state secrets”.\\nGui Minhai, a 53-year-old Hong Kong publisher who had specialised in gossipy books about China’s political elite, was taken from a Beijing-bound train on the morning of 20 January as he attempted to reach the Swedish embassy for a medical examination.\\nSweden’s foreign minister this week attacked China’s “brutal intervention” while Germany’s ambassador to Beijing denounced what he called the unprecedented treatment of an EU citizen. “There is a widespread fear that these violations of international laws … could happen to other EU citizens in the future,” Michael Clauss warned.\\nAngela Gui, the publisher’s daughter, told the Guardian: “I just hope there will be an update soon. But I have to say that at this point I’m not very optimistic that we’ll have any sort of good news any time soon.”\\nMystery continues to surround the politically charged and increasingly surreal saga of Gui Minhai, which began back in October 2015 when he vanished from his holiday home in Thailand.\\nGui subsequently reappeared in custody in mainland China, making what supporters condemned as a forced confession to involvement in a fatal hit-and-run incident in 2003. Four other booksellers, including one British citizen, were also seized leading to criticism from politicians in the UK, including then foreign secretary Philip Hammond.\\nGui, who became a Swedish citizen in 1992, had seemed close to release last autumn when it emerged he was living under surveillance in the eastern port city of Ningbo. However, those hopes were dashed when he was apprehended for the second time. His current whereabouts are unknown.\\nThe Guardian understands that on the day Gui Minhai was taken, Sweden’s ambassador to China, Anna Lindstedt, went to China’s foreign ministry seeking answers. Swedish diplomats were referred to police in Ningbo who confirmed the bookseller was in detention and suspected of trafficking in state secrets.\\nAngela Gui said: “There is no way that he would know any state secrets that wouldn’t have anything directly to do with his case. He was in incommunicado detention for two years. So who would have told him these state secrets?”\\n“I can only guess that it might have something to do with what happened when he was taken the first time. And that whoever ordered this didn’t want this to come out,” she added.\\nChina has dismissed criticism of its treatment of Gui, who supporters say was seeking medical treatment in Beijing because of fears he was suffering from a rare neurological disease.\\n“The Swedish side should know the case is serious in nature and some Swedish people have played an irresponsible role in this,” foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, told reporters, warning further criticism could damage bilateral relations.\\nOn Thursday an editorial in the Communist party-run tabloid, the Global Times, accused Sweden and Germany of “rudely provoking China’s judicial sovereignty” and claimed both countries should be ashamed of their “imperialist” meddling.\\nAngela Gui urged more western governments to confront Beijing over her father’s plight. “It’s important to be vocal and public about this and really I would have wished that this would have happened since the very beginning when he was taken 2015. I can’t help but wonder if the international community had been more vocal back then, if we would have this situation today.”\\n“Nobody knows what is going to happen now. But if China is claiming he committed all these crimes, and if they are not backing down on that, that suggests there’s going to be a trial. And I expect that if there is indeed a trial he will probably get a very long sentence because of the nature of the crimes he is suspected of.”\\n\\n### Response:\\n######\\n1.

The president then returned to the microphone to restate his claim that \"there has been nobody tougher on Russia than President Donald Trump.\"\\n\"We had a very, very severe ... fight in Syria recently [in February] between our troops and Russian troops and that’s very sad,\" the president said. \"Many people died in that fight.\"\\n\"With the media, no matter what I did, it’s never tough enough because that’s their narrative,\" Trump lamented. \"But Russia will tell you there has been nobody tougher than Donald Trump.\"\\nThe president spoke one day after an intra-administration quarrel over sanctions erupted in public earlier this week.\\nThe dispute began Sunday, when U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told CBS News\\' \"Face the Nation\" that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would announce new sanctions directed at Russian companies associated with Syria\\'s chemical weapons program on Monday, \"if he hasn\\'t already.\"\\nThree senior administration officials told The Associated Press that the sanctions would have been announced Friday night, at the same time U.S., French, and British forces launched a missile strike on Syrian President Bashar Assad\\'s chemical weapons facilities. But the sanctions were not ready in time for Trump\\'s statement announcing military, so they were delayed.\\nThe officials said a decision was then made to announce the sanctions as an answer to Russia\\'s response to the strikes. But that plan was re-evaluated and then put on hold over the weekend as it became clear that Russia\\'s response was less robust than anticipated. The officials were not authorized to discuss private administration deliberations publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.\\nA National Security Council memorandum sent overnight Friday said the new sanctions would be announced soon, but it did not specify a date. Over the next 36 hours, officials began to delve deeper into the proposed sanctions and decided to hold off on anything imminent, but Haley was unaware, the officials said.\\nAfter she made her comments on Sunday, the White House informed the Russian embassy that there would not be more sanctions as of now, an administration source told Fox News.\\nOn Monday, a new memo went out from the NSC saying that additional sanctions were under consideration, but no decision had been made.

Susan Collins, who got seemingly ironclad promises in order to sign her crucial vote onto the GOP\\'s tax reform bill (a banner achievement, but the Republicans\\' only real legislative accomplishment while controlling Congress and the White House). The tax bill also repealed the individual mandate -- the Obamacare requirement that Americans have health insurance or a pay a fine or tax.\\nOne of the things Collins got in exchange for her vote , she said at the time, was the assurance of the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that he would allow a vote on her plan along with Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson to give insurance companies money to help pay for the most expensive patients. Separately, there was to be a vote on a plan by Sens. Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, and Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, to temporarily shield insurance companies from President Donald Trump\\'s unilateral decision to end Obamacare cost-sharing subsidies that helped them provide coverage to 6 million lower-income Americans.\\nThat was back in December. The promise to Collins was for a vote by the end of the year.\\nBut the day after the tax vote, it was clear there would be no vote in 2017, something Collins acknowledged in a December 20 joint statement with Alexander, author of that separate bipartisan bill.\\nThere were already indications Democrats and Republicans in the House might not be on board for the same version of the proposals. Instead, Collins and Alexander said they would introduce the stablilization bills early in 2018 and debate it around the massive \"omnibus\" spending bill lawmakers use to fund the government.\\nAnd that brings us to Thursday, nearly a quarter of the way into 2018. Republican leaders on Wednesday released the massive omnibus -- which is thousands of pages long.\\nHere are a few ways to look at this:\\nCollins was effectively rolled; McConnell made his promise to get her vote without ever intending to follow through. Events conspired against her; McConnell made the promise, but then just couldn\\'t find a way to schedule the vote. He tried. He really did, but an immigration debate, a guns debate and other things just got in the way.\\nSpecifically, bipartisan agreement that the government should not just turn off its subsidy payments has turned into a fight over abortion . Republicans in the House wanted to add language barring federal funding for abortions to plans offered with government help on the private market. Democrats want to stick with current language that allows abortion coverage in these private plans, but requires a separate payment for such coverage.\\nSo, even though Senate leaders made their promise and Trump told Collins in a phone call over the weekend he supports what\\'s in her bill, for an unrelated reason -- abortion rights -- it will now not be in the omnibus spending bill. There\\'s also a very real question over whether the Collins proposal would result in stabilizing the market, as the Portland Press-Herald in Maine made clear.\\nThe end result (and the lesson for any lawmaker) is the same, however. Collins gave away the valuable thing she had and didn\\'t get what she wanted in return.\\nShe\\'s not the only one. Democrats pledged and promised they would do something to help undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children who signed up for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program\\nWhen he created that program, President Barack Obama promised the government would look out for them. When Trump ended the program, Democrats (and a lot of Republicans) promised to do something to fix the problem.\\nBut when it became clear that public opinion as turning away from them, Democrats gave in, agreed to re-open the government in exchange for a debate later on.\\nUnlike Collins, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer got his debate on immigration. It lasted a week and yielded no legislation, despite some bipartisan proposals. There was an opportunity to add protections for Dreamers in the omnibus, too, but they were also left out.\\nAgain, the lesson here is that if you really want something in Washington, you\\'re going to have to use up everything you\\'ve got in order to get it. And you\\'re going to have to get it in hand before you give away your leverage.\\nBecause the days of grand bipartisan debates in which lawmakers hash things out on the Senate or House floor are something of a myth at the moment.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

But alcohol abuse can take its toll on not only your health, but the economy as well. Buzz60\\nLiquor by the drink in Nashville, Tenn. on October 3, 2012. (Photo: Samuel M. Simpkins, The Tennessean)\\nExcessive drinking can lead to a variety of health problems and significantly shorten a person’s life. The habit claims nearly 90,000 lives each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And those who die as the result of alcohol abuse do so 30 years prematurely, on average.\\nExcessive alcohol consumption, according to the CDC, includes binge drinking and heavy drinking. Binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks in a single occasion for women and five or more for men, and heavy drinking is defined as at least eight drinks per week for women and 15 for men.\\nNationwide, 18.0% of American adults drink an excessive amount of alcohol. However, the excessive drinking rate ranges considerably across states. In some states, just over 1 in 10 adults drink too much on a regular basis, while in others, the share is closer to 1 in 4.\\nMore: Alcohol abuse: The drunkest city in every state\\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from the CDC to identify the states reporting the highest levels of adults who binge drink or drink heavily.\\n50.

However, it is not a rarity either as 11.2% of the adult population drinks excessively. Nationwide, a much higher percentage of adults report excessive drinking, at 18.0%.\\nExcessive drinking over time can lead to a myriad serious and potentially fatal health issues, including certain cancers, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease. Despite the relatively few adults who binge drink or drink heavily, Tennessee has one of the highest premature death rates of any state. For every 100,000 state residents, 436 die before age 75, the eighth highest premature death rate among states. Perhaps the adult smoking rate of 21.9% — the seventh highest share among all states — contributes to the higher premature death rate.\\n49. West Virginia\\nAdults drinking excessively: 11.4%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 32.0% (25th lowest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 23.7% (the highest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Morgantown, WV\\nOnly 11.4% of adults binge or heavily drink in West Virginia, much less than the 18.0% of adults who binge or heavily drink nationwide. States with lower excessive drinking rates are often home to lower income populations; and West Virginia is no exception. The state’s median household income of $43,385 is well below the median household income nationwide of $57,617, and the second lowest of any state.\\nAlcohol consumption is just one of many behavioral factors that can affect health outcomes and as a result, areas with low excessive drinking rates are not necessarily the healthiest. In West Virginia, nearly 24% of adults are in fair or poor health, the largest share of any state.\\n48. Utah\\nAdults drinking excessively: 12.4%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 19.7% (the lowest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 12.9% (6th lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Salt Lake City, UT\\nIn Utah, 12.4% of adults report excessive drinking, well below the 18.0% share of adults nationwide who either binge drink or drink heavily. States with a lower share of adults drinking excessively tend to have lower rates of alcohol-related driving deaths. Only 19.7% of driving deaths in Utah involve alcohol, the lowest alcohol-related driving death rate of any state and far below nationwide rate of 30.0%.\\nLow excessive drinking rates in Utah are partially attributable to religious faith. Over half of the state’s population identify as Mormon, a religion that expressly forbids alcohol consumption.\\nMore: Economic disparity: 10 States where the middle class is being left behind\\n47.

This is a considerably lower share than the 18.0% of adults who binge or drink heavily nationwide. Although excessive drinking can lead to serious health problems, including liver cancer and cardiovascular disease, states with lower shares of adults drinking excessively are often less healthy than states reporting higher shares of excessive drinking. An estimated 21.2% of adults in Alabama are in fair or poor health, the fourth largest share of any state.\\nAlcohol consumption is only one factor that can affect health. While Alabama adults drink less, many struggle with other health issues. For example, an estimated 34.0% of adults are obese, the fifth highest share among states.\\nCLOSE Drinking wine can help with weight loss, which is great news if you need to shed a few holiday pounds.

Despite the link between excessive drinking and a myriad of health problems, states with lower drinking rates tend to report worse health outcomes than states with higher drinking rates. In Mississippi, 22.2% of adults report being in fair or poor health — the third largest share of any state. This could be a function of income, as states with lower drinking rates also tend to have lower incomes, and poorer states generally report poorer health outcomes. Mississippi has the lowest median household income of all states at $41,754 a year and the highest poverty rate at 20.8%.\\nWhile excessive drinking is never healthy, it is only one behavioral factor that can affect health. For example, lack of exercise can lead to obesity and heart problems, and in Mississippi, 31.9% of adults lead completely sedentary lives, the highest share among all states and well above the national average of 22.0%.\\n45. New Mexico\\nAdults drinking excessively: 13.8%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 32.1% (25th highest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 20.2% (8th highest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Santa Fe, NM\\nSome 13.8% of adults in New Mexico binge drink or drink heavily, a smaller share than the 18.0% of American adults who do. Despite the lower excessive drinking rate, the state reports poorer health outcomes such as an above average premature death rate and a higher share of adults reporting being in fair or poor health.\\nIn general, states that have smaller shares of adults who drink heavily are likely to have lower incomes. New Mexico is one such example with a median household income of $46,748 a year, nearly $11,000 below the national figure of $57,617 and the seventh lowest median income nationwide. New Mexico also has the third highest poverty among all states at 19.8%.\\n44.

Over time, binge or heavy drinking can lead to many health problems. However, excessive drinking is only one of many factors that can contribute to poor health. Adults in Oklahoma are much more likely to be physically inactive and smoke than the typical American. Partially as a result, despite a lower binge and heavy drinking rate, about 1 in 4 adults in the state are in fair or poor health, the sixth highest share of any state.\\nMore: Financial security: Best (and worst) states to grow old in \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\n43.

In North Carolina, that share is much lower at 15%. Drinking too much alcohol on a regular basis can lead to many health complications — both short and long term — ranging from alcohol poisoning to certain cancers. Despite the lower percentage of adults drinking to excess, 18.5% of adults in North Carolina report being in poor or fair health, the 12th highest share of any state and well above the national average of 15%. One possible explanation for poorer health outcomes in North Carolina may be above average physical inactivity and obesity rates at 24.0% and 29.7%, respectively. Nationwide, 22% of adults get no exercise beyond getting up and going to work and 28% of adults are obese.\\n42.

States where binge drinking and drinking heavily are less common tend to have poorer health outcomes, despite the many negative health problems associated with excessive alcohol consumption. Drinking alcohol is an expensive unhealthy habit and tends to be less common in states with lower incomes — which often report worse health outcomes than wealthier states.\\nArkansas is no different. The state’s median annual household income of $44,334 is well below the national figure of $57,617.

Excessive drinking is never healthy and Idaho’s low excessive drinking rate partially explains some positive health outcomes. A key measure of health is the premature death rate, and Idaho’s is below average. For every 100,000 state residents, 310 die before the age of 75. Nationwide, there are 333 deaths before age 75 for every 100,000 people.\\nAccording to the CDC, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to risky sexual behavior — and Idaho’s low excessive drinking rate may partially explain a low incidence of sexually transmitted diseases. There are 337 diagnoses of chlamydia per 100,000 state residents annually, one the lowest such rates among states and well below the U.S. rate of 456 per 100,000.\\n40.

According to the CDC, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to depression and anxiety — and Maryland’s low excessive drinking rate may help explain better than average mental health outcomes. Adults in the state report an average of just 3.4 mentally unhealthy days per month, fewer than the 3.7-day national average.\\nStates with smaller shares of adults who drink excessively tend to have lower median household incomes. Maryland, however, is the exception. The median annual household income in the state of $78,945 is the highest of any state and over $20,000 above the national median of $57,617.\\nMore: U.S. economy: A rundown of the poorest county in every state\\n39.

Drinking large quantities of alcohol can lead to many health issues, yet states with lower shares of adults drinking excessively tend to be less healthy than those with higher shares. For example, the premature death rate is higher in Nevada than in most states — likely due to several factors other than alcohol consumption. For every 100,000 people in Nevada, 360 die before the age of 75.\\n38.

Despite this, states with a lower portion of adults who drink in excess tend to report poorer health outcomes than those with larger portions of adults who drink excessively. In Arizona, 16% of adults engage in binge drinking or drinking heavily, less than the national average of 18%.

Excessive drinking can lead to a slew of health conditions such as hypertension and liver disease. However, states with lower shares of adults who binge drink or drink heavily are typically less healthy than those with higher shares of adults who drink excessively. In Kentucky, nearly 21% of adults report they are in fair or poor health, the seventh highest share of all states. This could be because many of the states that report lower excessive drinking rates have lower incomes — and states with lower incomes and higher poverty rates tend to report less healthful behavior and worse health outcomes than wealthier states.\\nThis appears to be the case in Kentucky, which is one of the poorest states in the country. The state reports 25.9% smoking rate among adults, the highest of any state. Also, 32.9% of state adults are obese, which is well above the national obesity rate of 28%.\\n36.

States with low incomes and high poverty rates tend to report worse health outcomes than wealthier states, and this is the case in South Carolina. The median income of households in the state is $49,501 a year, which is well below the nationwide median household income of $57,617. The poverty rate in South Carolina is 15.3%, one of the higher state poverty rates.\\nWhile drinking too much alcohol is unhealthy, it is only one factor that can cause adverse health effects. Obesity and smoking are some of the other factors. In South Carolina, 31.8% of adults are obese — the ninth highest share of any state — and the smoking rate is higher than the national average.\\n35.

Typically, states where the excessive drinking rate is lower also have lower shares of deaths from alcohol-involved car crashes. Despite a lower share of adults who drink excessively, 37.9% of all deaths from car crashes in South Carolina are related to alcohol consumption, the sixth highest share of any state.\\nMore: Economic inequality: The worst states for Hispanics and Latinos\\n34.

Binge or heavy drinking can lead to many health issues, including high blood pressure, stroke, and long-term memory problems. Like many states reporting lower excessive drinking rates, incomes are lower in Indiana. The median household income of $52,314 a year, below the national median household income of $57,617.\\nDespite the relatively low excessive drinking rate in Indiana, the premature death rate in the state of 387 deaths before the age of 75 for every 100,000 people is the 10th highest. This is likely — at least in part — the result of the high obesity rate in the state, which at 31.7% is also the 10th highest of all states. Earning a low income makes it challenging to afford healthful food and and exercise opportunities, and the state’s low income helps explain its high obesity rate.\\n33.

Nationwide, 18% of adults binge drink or drink heavily. Excessive drinking over time can lead to myriad health issues, both mentally and physically, including depression and cardiovascular disease. Despite the lower share of adults who drink to excess, Georgia has a relatively high premature death rate. An estimated 377 of every 100,000 people die before the age of 75 in Georgia. Excess consumption of alcohol is only one factor that can contribute to poor health — obesity can also cause serious health complications.

Excessive drinking of alcohol can lead to a variety of health issues, including, but not limited to, breast, liver, and colon cancer. Despite the lower drinking rate, Kansas does not report the best health outcomes. For example, 30.8% of adult residents are obese, likely partially due to the fact that 23.5% of adults lead sedentary lives.

Despite a lower heavy drinking rate, 19.3% of adults in Texas report they are in fair or poor health, which is the 10th highest share among all 50 states. It is likely that the high percentage of adults who are physically inactive in the state contributes to its poor health outcomes. Some 23% of adults in Texas lead sedentary lifestyles, higher than the national average inactivity rate.\\n30.

In Virginia, 17.4% of adults report drinking to excess. States with lower portions of adults binge drinking or drinking heavily tend to report less healthy outcomes. That is likely because many of these states are generally poorer — and low income states tend to report worse health than wealthier states. The opposite is true for Virginia, however. The state’s median household income of $68,114 a year is well above the national median, and the poverty rate is just 11%. The nationwide poverty rate is 14%.\\nPartially due to the state’s higher incomes, Virginia adults tend to be quite healthy, reporting below-average obesity, smoking, and premature death rates.\\n29.

Typically, states with below average shares of adults who binge drink or drink heavily have lower incomes and higher poverty rates. In Florida, the median household income of $50,860 a year is about $6,800 less than the national figure. Those with lower incomes often lack access to luxuries including alcohol and healthy foods. A diet that lacks a diversity of nutritious foods can result in poor health outcomes, which helps explain why 17.1% of adults in Florida report they are in fair or poor health. For perspective, only 15% of American adults report they are in fair or poor health.\\n28.

Despite a lower frequency of adults drinking heavily, 35.3% of deaths from car crashes involve alcohol, the 10th highest share of any state. This factor, along with a higher smoking rate, may contribute to the above average premature death rate in Wyoming. Some 347 people die before age 75 for every 100,000 people in Wyoming, which is higher than the nationwide rate of about 333 premature deaths per every 100,000 Americans.\\n27.

The median household income in the state of $76,126 a year is the third highest income among all states. Likely because those with higher incomes are able to afford better access to health care and healthy lifestyles, New Jersey reports some of the better health outcomes nationwide.

Alaska\\nAdults drinking excessively: 22.1%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 33.8% (16th highest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 13.7% (12th lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Fairbanks, AK\\nSome 22.1% of adults in Alaska report drinking excessively, the third highest share of all states and well above the comparable national share of 18%. States with higher excessive drinking rates tend to be wealthier, partially because alcohol can be expensive to buy regularly. In Alaska, the median household income of $76,440 a year is the second largest of any state, greatly exceeds the national income of $57,617.\\n2. Wisconsin\\nAdults drinking excessively: 24.5%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 36.9% (8th highest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 14.0% (13th lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Green Bay, WI\\nSome 24.5% of adults in Wisconsin report binge or heavy drinking — the second largest share of any state and well above the comparable national share of 18%. Drinking alcohol regularly over long periods of time can lead to many serious ailments later in life such as liver cancer and even dementia. Despite high rates of excessive drinking, Wisconsin has a relatively low premature death rate. For every 100,000 residents, about 300 will die before the age of 75, less deaths than in most other states.\\n1. North Dakota\\nAdults drinking excessively: 24.7%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 46.7% (the highest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 13.4% (9th lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Fargo, ND-MN\\nThe state with the highest share of adults drinking excessively is North Dakota, with nearly 25% of adults reporting binge drinking or drinking heavily. Not surprisingly, the state with the highest drinking rate also has the highest rate of alcohol-related driving deaths. A total of 46.7% of all roadway fatalities are attributable to alcohol consumption, much higher than the national share of 30%.\\nDrinking excessively on a regular basis is not healthy. Still, 13.4% of adults report they are in fair or poor health, despite the state’s above average obesity and smoking rates.\\nTo identify the drunkest states in America, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the percentage of men and women over 18 who report binge or heavy drinking in every state. Excessive alcohol consumption, according to the CDC, includes binge drinking and heavy drinking. Binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks in a single occasion for women and five or more for men, and heavy drinking is defined as at least eight drinks per week for women and 15 for men.

Kissinger’s negotiations led directly to Nixon’s historic visit to China some months later.\\nNixon had reshuffled the diplomatic deck and played the China card. As a result, the strategic calculus that had governed the Cold War for decades underwent a tectonic shift in America’s favor.\\nNow we learn that CIA Director Mike Pompeo secretly met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un on Easter weekend. President Trump has confirmed that Pompeo’s negotiations have laid the groundwork for a summit in late May or early June to discuss the rogue state’s nuclear weapons program. “Denuclearization would be a great thing for the world, as well as for North Korea,” the President tweeted.\\nLike Nixon, Trump is boldly reshuffling the deck. And, in like manner, the strategic calculus that has governed the standoff on the Korean Peninsula for decades is starting to shift in our favor.\\nIn January, Kim Jong-un suddenly agreed to talks with the South, and in February sent a team to South Korea’s Winter Olympics. The first summit between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Kim will take place on April 27. In a further surprise, the North Korean dictator has apparently agreed to discuss formally ending the Korean War, which began when his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, invaded the south some 68 years ago.\\nThe most startling news is that Pyongyang, according to South Korea’s president, has just agreed to Trump’s demand for “complete denuclearization.” And this without any strings attached, such as the withdrawal of American troops.\\nKim Jong-un was even galvanized — again by Trump, of course – to venture beyond the borders of his hermit kingdom for the first time since assuming power in 2011. In late March, Kim visited his chief international patron (and fellow president for life), Chinese President Xi Jinping.\\nAccording to the Nikkei Asian Review, Xi talked to Kim about the ongoing power struggle between the U.S. and China, and what it means in the context of something called “Project 2035.” Project 2035 is a grand scheme for building China into a “great modern socialist country” by the year 2035. Announced at last October’s National Party Congress, its goal is a China that is stronger in both economic and military terms than the United States.\\nWhy would Xi share his “China Dream” of one day becoming the world’s dominant power with Kim? Perhaps to remind him that at the present time, in the face of renewed U.S. confidence, economic growth, and military resolve, it is better to be conciliatory with Trump. “I’m playing the long game,” he may have suggested to Kim. “You should, too.”\\nNone of this would have happened if the hapless Hillary Clinton had been elected. Like previous American presidents, she would probably have tried to once again bribe North Korea into behaving itself. And like previous presidents from her husband on, she would have only thereby encouraged further extortionate behavior.\\nIt is Trump’s toughness that has gotten us this far. Instead of bribing North Korea to suspend its weapons and missile programs, he is choking it (and its giant neighbor to the north) with ever-tightening sanctions.\\nBolstering the sanctions regime is the threat of military action, made credible by the near-annihilation of the Islamic State and the surgical strikes in Syria, among other things. Young Kim knows that, if a denuclearization agreement can’t be hammered out, that he might wake up one morning to find his nuclear and missile facilities a smoldering ruin.\\nWe used to say that only Nixon, with his strong anti-communist credentials, could have gone to China.\\nIt may well turn out to be the case that only Trump, with his steely resolve, can broker a deal with Kim.\\nIt is still early days, but the end of the Korean War and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would fundamentally change the strategic calculus of East Asia.\\nOf course, Nixon going to China was not an unmixed blessing. Although the U.S.-China détente increased the pressure on the Soviet Union while helping hundreds of millions of Chinese escape poverty, it also contributed to the rise of a Chinese Party-State that is increasingly hostile to everything America stands for.\\nIn the case of North Korea, our goal must be to (1) convince Little Rocket Man to give up his dangerous toys and (2) reconcile himself to living with his southern neighbors in peace. In so doing, we should be careful not to strengthen his despotic regime which – with or without nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles – will continue to repress its own people.\\nWith the North Korean threat off the strategic chessboard, America and its allies can focus on the real danger to the present world order: China itself.\\nSteven W.

He made this claim during his speech accepting the Republican nomination in July 2016. At the time, it struck me simply as a delusional expression of his grandiosity. Looking back, I also hear the plaintive wail of a desperate child who believes he is alone in the world with no one to care for him. “I alone can do it” is Trump’s survival response to: “I must do it all alone.”\\nThere are two Trumps. The one he presents to the world is all bluster, bullying and certainty. The other, which I have long felt haunts his inner world, is the frightened child of a relentlessly critical and bullying father and a distant and disengaged mother who couldn’t or wouldn’t protect him.\\n“That’s why I’m so screwed up, because I had a father who pushed me so hard,” Trump acknowledged in 2007, in a brief and rare moment of self-awareness.\\nYou can say what you like on Twitter – as long as you’re US president | Christian Christensen Read more\\nTrump’s temperament and his habits have hardened with age. He was always cartoonish, but compared with the man for whom I wrote The Art of the Deal 30 years ago, he is significantly angrier today: more reactive, deceitful, distracted, vindictive, impulsive and, above all, self-absorbed – assuming the last is possible.\\nThis is the narrative I’ve been advancing for the past 18 months. With the recent publication of Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury, it turns out that even those closest to Trump recognise his utter lack of fitness to be president, even if they are too cowed and cowardly to do anything about it.\\nFear is the hidden through-line in Trump’s life – fear of weakness, of inadequacy, of failure, of criticism and of insignificance. He has spent his life trying to outrun these fears by “winning” – as he puts it – and by redefining reality whenever the facts don’t serve the narrative he seeks to create. It hasn’t worked, but not for lack of effort.\\nIn his first year in office, Trump has lambasted any facts he dislikes as “fake news”, while making nearly 2,000 false or misleading claims of his own – more than five a day. In a single half-hour interview with the New York Times in late December, he made 24 such claims. This is the very definition of gaslighting – lying until you get people to doubt their own reality – and it is both frightening and disturbing. Because the office Trump now occupies makes him the most powerful man on Earth, his fears, and the way he manages them, have necessarily become ours.\\nWe fear Trump because he is impulsive, irrational and self-serving, but above all because he seems unconstrained by even the faintest hint of conscience. Trump feels no more shame over his most destructive behaviours than a male lion does killing the cubs of his predecessor when he takes over a pride.\\nTrump has made fear the dominant emotion of our times. This, I believe, is his primary impact on the body politic after a year in office. He began his campaign by describing immigrant Mexicans as rapists, Muslims as terrorists, and more recently all black and brown people, and entire countries, as inferior. Trump skilfully exploited the fears of supporters who felt powerless and disenfranchised by presenting himself as their angry champion, even though the policies he has since pursued are likely to make their lives worse.\\nAbout the only thing Trump truly has in common with his base is that he feels every bit as aggrieved as they do, despite his endless privilege. No amount of money, fame or power has been enough to win him the respect he so insatiably craves. His anger over this perceived injustice is visceral and authentic. Trump’s unwinding of government programmes such as Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act will fuel yet more fear among the millions of people will lose their health care in the year ahead. The tax plan Trump pushed through most benefits him, his family and his fellow billionaires and provides the least relief to those who need it most. In both cases, the victims of these policies will include millions of his supporters who may find someone else to blame, but whose suffering will inexorably increase.\\nxmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"> The Trumpian world view is narrow, dark and deficit-driven\\nThe fearful divide Trump has exacerbated is not simply between his supporters and his detractors, the rich and the poor, or Democrats and Republicans, but between the best and the worst in each of us.\\nIn the face of fear, it is a physiological fact that our most primitive and selfish instincts emerge. Control of our behaviour shifts from the prefrontal cortex to the emotionally driven amygdala – sometimes referred to as “fear central”. As we move into fight-or-flight mode, we become more self-centred, and our vision narrows to the perceived threat, which in the modern world is less to our survival than to our sense of value and worthiness. We lose the capacity for empathy, rationality, proportionality and attention to the longer-term consequences of our actions.\\nThis is the reactive state Trump has tapped into with his followers and which he has prompted in his opponents. It serves none of us well. Think for a moment about the immense difference between how you feel and behave at your best and your worst. It is when we feel safest and most secure that we think most clearly and expansively. It’s also when we are most inclined to look beyond our self-interest, and to act with compassion, generosity, consideration and forgiveness.\\nI have never observed any of these qualities in Trump. Over the past year I have frequently been asked whether he has any redeeming qualities. I’ve thought about this as objectively as I can, and the only one I’ve come up with is his relentless drive. But because Trump uses this quality solely in the service of his self-aggrandisement and domination, it scarcely qualifies as a virtue.\\nSo what does resistance to Trump look like? This is a question that has preoccupied me and millions of other Americans this past year. If fear gets sufficiently intense, or persists for long enough, we eventually move into “freeze” – meaning numbness and submission. This is my own greatest fear. As Trump violates one norm after another day after day, the risk is that we lose our sense of outrage and our motivation to speak out.\\nThe challenge we face is to resist our own fear without sacrificing our outrage. That requires widening our perspective beyond Trump’s, and beyond Trump himself. The future is ours to shape, not his. Dispiriting as I found it to write The Art of the Deal with a man I progressively came to view as a black hole, the experience prompted me to redirect my life in almost complete opposition to the values and world view that he represents. My own path over the past two decades – prompted in reaction to my experience with him – has been to help business leaders become more wholly human, and to humanise workplaces.\\nTrump’s actions over the past year have already prompted an extraordinary wave of new activism among people in their 20s and 30s, who are now the biggest segment of the US electorate, and represent the next generation of leaders. The 19 women who stepped forward to accuse Trump of sexual assault have helped to galvanise a rapidly growing, worldwide movement to empower women and to call out sexual abuse in the workplace. Thanks in large part to Trump, hundreds of new female candidates are now running for political office.\\n‘Shithole countries’? Words worthy of a racist-in-chief | Richard Wolffe Read more\\nTrump himself has become the embodiment of the limits of traditional masculinity. “We raise boys,” writes the author Terrence Real, “to live in a world in which they are either winners or losers, grandiose or shame-filled, … perpetrators or victims. Society shows little mercy for men if they fail in the performance of their role. But the price of that performance is an inward sickness.”\\nTrump represents an extreme version of a sickness from which most men suffer, to some extent. The most powerful stand we can take in opposition to Trump’s values and behaviour is to pursue a higher purpose every day, seek more common ground amid our differences, and find better ways to take care of others and add value wherever we can. As he looks backward, we must look forward.\\nThe Trumpian worldview is narrow, dark and deficit-driven. Each of us shares some of those instincts: the fear of inadequacy is uniquely and universally human. But we are also capable of so much more. My hope and belief is that Trump will no longer be president by this year’s end. My personal commitment is to pay much less attention to him, and more to making a difference to others affected by his policies. Whatever happens, may the worst of Trump inspire the best in us.\\nWe, together, can do it.\\n• Tony Schwartz is the chief executive of The Energy Project.

It also raised questions about whether a cheaper testing method should be used.\\nIn more than 4 million blood donations checked in the United States, nine tested positive for the Zika virus. Of those, three were considered an infection threat.\\n\"We can\\'t afford to spend that kind of money to find a single case,\" said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University infectious diseases expert who was not involved in the research.\\nZika infections swept across Latin America and the Caribbean in 2015 and 2016, with a few very small outbreaks in the southern United States. The virus is mainly spread by tropical mosquitoes, but scientists also discovered some infections were spread through sex.\\nFearing Zika might also spread through transfusions, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2016 called on all blood banks to screen for it.\\n\"The risk from transfusion was poorly known. We put this testing in place as a precaution without really having solid data about the necessity for it,\" said Dr. Darrell Triulzi, a University of Pittsburgh transfusion medicine specialist.\\nThe new study is the first large one to evaluate whether the testing made sense, he added.\\nThe researchers looked at the results of screenings done by the American Red Cross, which collects 42 percent of the U.S. blood supply.

We do not want to skimp on simple pleasures and die with lots of money in the bank. But we also don\\'t want to run through our savings too soon. So how do we calculate withdrawals from our nest egg to spend as much as possible of our assets before we shuffle off this mortal coil? --E.S.\\nYou\\'d think that having a great time spending all the money you\\'ve socked away for retirement would be a cinch. After all, the whole point of saving and investing in 401(k)s and other retirement accounts during your working years is to enjoy yourself after calling it a career.\\nBut a number of recent studies suggest that many people may have a harder time spending down their retirement nest egg than you may think. For example, a 2016 study of retiree spending habits found that with the exception of those of modest means, retirees on average were spending less then they could actually afford, while wealthy retirees were spending less than half of the amount their savings and other resources would support.\\nAnd last year when researchers for the BlackRock Retirement Institute examined the spending and savings of thousands of people who retired in the early 1990s, they not only found that most of these retirees still had at least half of their retirement savings remaining after nearly 20 years of retirement, but that many actually had a larger nest egg than when when they entered retirement.\\nThere can be several explanations for this seeming reluctance to spend down one\\'s savings. Some retirees, especially those with considerable amounts of money tucked away, may plan on leaving a portion of their savings to their heirs or charity. Many are no doubt being cautious because they fear they\\'ll incur large medical expenses late in life or that they\\'ll run through their savings too early and have to scrimp in their dotage.\\nBut others may simply have trouble making the transition from saving to spending. After years of thrift, they have developed an extreme reluctance to spend, or a condition I\\'ve dubbed \"Spendaphobia,\" which makes it difficult for them to loosen their purse strings and enjoy the benefits of all those years of saving for the future.\\nRelated: A 3-step plan to a secure retirement\\nWhich brings us back to your question: How do you improve your chances of spending so that you enjoy your time in retirement as much as you can, yet not overdo it and jeopardize your financial security or even outlive your nest egg?\\nThe best way to start is by doing a full-fledged retirement budget, as this will give you a sense of what your actual expenses will be after you retire and how much you\\'ll have to spend to maintain your current standard of living. You can create such a budget by going to an online tool like BlackRock\\'s Retirement Expense Worksheet, which allows you to enter upwards of 50 expense items in eight broad categories that cover both essential (housing, health care, food, transportation, etc.) and discretionary (entertainment, charitable contributions, whatever) spending.\\nYou won\\'t be able to predict your spending with 100% certainty (although, if you do some lifestyle planning, or giving serious thought to how you\\'ll live after you retire, you\\'ll come away with a more accurate estimate than if you just wing it). But the idea is to do the best you can and then refine your estimates as you near and enter retirement.\\nOnce you have a decent idea of how much you\\'ll need to spend (at least initially), you\\'ll want to gauge whether Social Security, any pensions and draws from your savings will be able to support that level of spending. You can make that assessment by going to a good retirement calculator like T. Rowe Price\\'s Retirement Income Calculator.\\nYou enter such information as your age, current income, the current value of your savings and the amount you expect to receive from any pensions and Social Security (the tool will automatically estimate your payment or you can go to Social Security\\'s Retirement Estimator). The tool will then estimate the chances that your savings will be able to generate enough income (after taking Social Security and any pensions into account) for the rest of your life to support your desired level of spending. (If you plan to leave assets to charity or heirs, you can earmark that amount and exclude it from the analysis.)\\nTo feel reasonably secure that you won\\'t outlive your savings, I\\'d think you\\'d want to see an estimate of 80% or better that your savings will last a lifetime. Generally, if you start with an initial annual withdrawal equal to 3% to 4% of savings -- or $30,000 to $40,000 for a $1 million nest egg -- and then adjust that amount each year for inflation to maintain purchasing power, you\\'ll likely come in close to that 80%-or-better target.\\nIf the tool estimates a success rate much lower than that, however, you may want to revise your planned spending down a bit. Conversely, if the chances of your savings supporting you the rest of your life come in a lot higher than 80%, you might consider spending some more.\\nBut whatever level of spending you start with, you need to be ready to adjust it up or down as conditions change. For example, if your nest egg\\'s value declines sharply because the financial markets take a big hit as they did during the 2008 financial crisis, you may want to forgo an inflation increase or even scale back your planned withdrawal to avoid running through your assets too soon.\\nIf, on the other hand, your savings balance begins to balloon because the markets are churning out well-above-average gains, as has been the case in recent years, you may want to splurge a bit and boost your spending so that you don\\'t end up with a big pile of assets late in retirement along with regrets you didn\\'t spend more early in retirement when you might have enjoyed yourself more.\\nBy making such adjustments and periodically re-visiting a retirement income calculator throughout retirement with updated information about your savings balance and planned withdrawals, you should be able to get a sense of whether you\\'re spending down your nest egg at a \"Goldilocks\" pace, i.e., not too fast but not too slow.\\nRelated: How much income will you actually need in retirement?\\nOne more thing you can do to boost your odds of having a happier and more rewarding retirement is spend in ways that have been shown to generate more satisfaction and happiness for retirees.\\nWhen Michael Finke of The American College and other researchers looked last year at the spending habits of some 1,500 retirees, they concluded that only one type of spending predicted retirement satisfaction -- namely, the money they spend on leisure activities, including travel, entertainment, dining out and hobbies. Finke believes such spending tends to boost happiness because it keeps us more active and socially engaged. (For what it\\'s worth, Merrill Lynch research has found that seniors who give back in some way, whether volunteering or contributing to organizations whose values and aims they support, were more likely to say they were happier and had a strong sense of purpose in life.)\\nNeither I nor anyone else can offer a spending formula or specific withdrawal percentage that will guarantee you won\\'t run through your savings while you\\'re still alive and kicking while ensuring that you won\\'t leave behind any more money than you wish. There are too many uncertainties -- how the markets will perform, how long you\\'ll live, how your spending needs might change, etc. -- for such guarantees.\\nBut if you start with a level of spending that\\'s reasonable, monitor and adjust your outlays as you go along and to the extent possible direct your spending to areas that have the highest happiness payoff so to speak, you should be able to enjoy retirement and get the most out of money you\\'ve managed to save.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Both Japanese and American flu patients were included in the trial.\\nThe experimental drug worked three times faster than another antiviral drug, Tamiflu, the company told the Journal.\\nThe drug uses a different approach to fight the flu than other medications. The flu virus spreads through the body by invading cells. Once inside a cell, it hijacks the cell's machinery, forcing the cell to make copies of the virus. Then, the newly copied viruses break out of the cell, spreading to other cells nearby and repeating the process.\\nExisting drugs, including Tamiflu, work to block these viral copies from escaping the cell, the Journal reported. The experimental drug, however, kicks into action earlier, working to block the virus from hijacking cells in the first place, the Journal said.\\nJapanese drug regulators could approve the drug for use in Japan by early March, the Journal reported.

But now the plans have collapsed amid accusations of fraud – all strongly denied – leaving the cities scarred with abandoned building sites and a trail of angry investors from around the world demanding to know where their money has gone.\\nOn Norfolk Street, in Liverpool’s trendy Baltic Quarter, stands the six-storey concrete carcass of what was supposed to be Baltic House, launched in 2015 as a “groundbreaking” development of student flats and creative live-work units. It was the first phase of the Gallery+ project, an “elegant, cool, urban and edgy” mixed-use scheme, centred around a gallery of Banksy murals that had been ripped from nearby walls. It was one of many such glamorous projects devised by property company North Point Global, marketed with great fanfare in China and Hong Kong and sold off-plan to investors with the lucrative promise of high yields, before mysteriously grinding to a halt. Three years on, the company has pulled out of its planned £360m suite of projects across the city and stopped picking up the phone, leaving buyers to believe they are the victims of a ruthless scam, fiercely denied by the developers in question.\\nHow Baltic House was supposed to look – and how it looked last week\\n“We all thought the UK was a safe place to invest,” says Florence Leung, a retired Hong Kong accountant who put a substantial chunk of her life savings into a unit in Baltic House, and has since had to return to work to make ends meet.\\nAlong with many others, Leung said she was wooed at a lavish promotional roadshow at a hotel in Hong Kong and convinced to pay 80% of the price of a student flat upfront, with promises of 6% interest on her deposit, followed by guaranteed 9% returns in rental income once the project was finished. Months later, buyers received requests for further funds to complete the building, before North Point Global announced it was stopping work all together – and couldn’t refund the buyers’ deposits.\\nRevealed: the collapsed UK property schemes luring small investors Read more\\nGroups of frustrated buyers have since raised what they believe to be serious conflicts of interest, with the same individuals simultaneously acting as directors of the development companies, contractors and independent surveyors – claims that have been denied by all parties involved.\\nQ&A What is buyer-funded development? Show Hide It is an increasingly popular model of financing property developments by using deposits from many individual buyers. Apartments are sold off-plan to buyers, often overseas, who pay substantial deposits of up to 80% upfront. Their money is used to fund the entire project, from marketing fees to construction costs. The model has become more commonplace since the financial crisis of 2008, after which it became harder for developers to borrow from banks and institutional lenders to fund their schemes. It is seen as a risky form of investment as construction often begins without the commitment of funding to complete it, and there is no safety net if costs balloon beyond projections and funds run out. The Solicitors’ Regulation Authority has warned of \"substantial risks” of misappropriation of money the developer failing to deliver on the proposal or becoming insolvent, with buyers “unwittingly financing high risk or fraudulent property development.”\\n“The UK government must take action,” says James To Kun-sun, a member of Hong Kong’s legislative council, who has been inundated with complaints from hundreds of local buyers claiming they have been victims of UK property fraud. He estimates more than 700 buyers have lost an average of HK$500,000 (£45,000) in Hong Kong alone, with many more across Asia and beyond. “People here have a sentimental link with the UK, as a place with a responsible government, democracy and the rule of law, so it is shocking that this can be allowed to happen. It seems the development industry isn’t properly regulated and politicians are willing to endorse any kind of project. In Hong Kong we reformed our system 40 years ago, so buyers’ deposits cannot be released to the developer until a project is completed.”\\nBuyers were aghast to discover that most of their money had been spent before a single brick had been laid\\nIn 2015, then-chancellor George Osborne led a UK government trade mission to China, accompanied by the Mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, to trumpet the “golden era” of Sino-British relations. They were there to sell the Northern Pitchbook, a £24bn catalogue of investment opportunities, one highlight of which was Liverpool’s New Chinatown. Devised by North Point Global, this flagship £200m development of 800 luxury flats was to stand in the shadow of the Anglican Cathedral, as a dramatic cluster of angular towers rising above a Chinese bazaar.\\n“We have an idea, because of Liverpool’s links to China, of a new Chinese-themed attraction to bring it all to life,” Osborne told the Liverpool Echo in September 2015, speaking on the phone from Chengdu. “I’ve just been talking to one of the Chinese investors at the Liverpool stand,” he continued. “And Joe and I were going at it as a tag team, to try and persuade him to put his money into Liverpool.”\\n‘Joe and I were going at it as a tag team’ ... George Osborne, then chancellor, pictured with the mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, describes how the pair promoted some of the failed property schemes in Asia\\nLittle did Osborne know that the project he was so eagerly promoting would end in limbo, with investors out of pocket, contractors in administration and the council taking the developer to court.\\n“Liverpool’s reputation has been trashed,” says Cllr Richard Kemp, leader of the city’s Liberal Democrats. “Buyers were led to believe these projects were backed by the council, because of the mayor and his deputy’s promotional visits, but they were nothing of the sort. The council flogged off the land without doing any due diligence on who they were selling it to, and now we won’t see the money.”\\nDeputy mayor Gary Millar, meanwhile, has travelled to China and Hong Kong at least seven times in the last five years to promote investment opportunities in Liverpool, and has been pictured toasting buyers at North Point Global promotional events. He denies any wrongdoing. “I completely understand the investors’ frustration with their stalled schemes,” he told the Liverpool Echo. “However, I know I did nothing wrong.”\\nHow they did it\\nThis risky form of buyer-funded development (sometimes known as investor-led fractional sales) has mushroomed since the 2008 financial crisis, after which banks grew reluctant to finance property. Instead, many developers have turned to individual buyers to fund the entire cost of development, using their hefty deposits to pay for everything from marketing to professional fees and construction costs. Whereas a conventional model of off-plan development sees the buyers’ deposits (typically 10% of purchase price) held in a secure escrow account, and only released on completion of the building, this alternative form of buyer-funded development sees investors paying up to 80%, which can be spent on all manner of costs and fees before construction has even begun.\\nA close network of individuals crop up in different companies, \\u200b\\u200boften registered to the same address\\n“It’s an incredibly risky form of investment,” says Clifford Tibber, expert in property law at Anthony Gold solicitors. “Very often the developments are not legitimate ... Developers are bypassing banks and targeting unsophisticated individuals who are willing to throw their life savings at a chance of making big profits.”\\nLast year the Solicitors Regulation Authority warned solicitors not to get involved in such projects: “our view is that they involve consumer clients unwittingly financing high risk or fraudulent property development”. The SRA notice describes a process whereby “investors provide money for a ‘deposit’ which is released to the seller upon some (often spurious) condition. [...] This carries substantial risks such as the money being misappropriated, the seller failing to complete the scheme or the seller becoming insolvent.”\\nIn the last year, the SRA has taken action against eight law firms involved in such schemes and investigated cases with reported investor losses of over £100m. The northwest regional organised crime unit, Titan, is now considering a number of cases, after hundreds of buyers have come forward with similar allegations.\\nThe Angelgate development in Manchester. More than £30m was taken in buyers deposits before the firm went into administration\\nOne of the most prominent is the Angelgate development in Manchester, a scheme of 344 luxury apartments launched in 2015 by Pinnacle, a company linked to former convicted conman Tony Freeman, whose home was reportedly raided in July 2017 over a £3m tax fraud probe. Pinnacle said the raid was a personal investigation and nothing to do with the company, and said Freeman works for it as a consultant but denied that he has any involvement in the firm’s ownership. Once again, the Angelgate units were sold off-plan to investors, many in Asia, with more than £30m taken in buyers’ deposits before the firm was forced into administration last year.\\nBuyers were aghast to discover that most of their money had already been spent before a single brick had been laid. As the administrator’s report states: “It is not clear how on any basis [Pinnacle] could justify spending 40% of the funds received from buyers on sales and marketing commissions,” adding that an additional £5.1m had been paid to the contractor, despite no construction work having begun. A spokesperson for Pinnacle insists that “foundational work” had been conducted, and blames the situation on the collapse of the contractor, PHD1, which had “significantly under-valued the build”.\\n‘Outrageous’\\nSurveyor David Choules, whose company Inca Management was responsible for certifying the stages of work, agrees that the developer’s fees were “considerable and outrageous”. “They changed their financial appraisal a couple of times during the project and decided to take out more fees,” he says. “But, as the certifier, it wasn’t our position to challenge that. We can have an opinion, but it’s down to the lawyers to advise.”\\nDeputy mayor of Liverpool Gary Millar (left) and Peter McInnes (right) with Samson Law of Hong Kong Homes at a promotional event for Asian investors. Millar travelled to Asia seven times. McInnes has been linked to a pair of jailed gangsters\\nSolicitor David Roberts, the lawyer who managed the buyers’ accounts for a number of these failed schemes, says: “Our role was to administer the funds in accordance with the sales agreement, which the buyers had voluntarily entered into. Once Inca certified the expenditure, the invoices became payable and we released the money to the developer.”\\nPinnacle said it was not true that commissions or fees had been used to extract money from Angelgate, adding that “absolutely no profits have been recognised from this development”. The spokesperson added that Pinnacle had never been contacted by police, and said, “If they ever were, they would fully cooperate.”\\nConcerned buyers have highlighted a series of connections between Pinnacle and North Point Global, and a recurring pattern of events – chief among which was their deposits being released to the developer without much sign of work taking place.\\nThey point to a close network of individuals who crop up in different roles at a variety of companies, often all registered to the same address – the 2nd floor of the Edward Pavilion in Liverpool’s Albert Dock.\\nIt seems … politicians are willing to endorse any kind of project James To Kun-sun\\nNorth Point Global was founded here in 2015 by Peter McInnes, who had worked with Tony Freeman to build a series of earlier Pinnacle schemes in Chester, Canterbury and Liverpool with his construction firm PHD1, before the two parted ways. McInnes – who has lived in Dubai for the last decade – was never a director or shareholder of either North Point Global or PHD1, but was described as chairman of both firms in their press releases. He has since denied chairing either company. He quickly established a buzz around the North Point brand, launching projects from North Point Pall Mall in Liverpool, with “sky gardens” and “rooftop paddle courts”, to the Element in Old Trafford, Manchester.\\n“He’s a very dynamic personality,” says property consultant Samuel Beilin, an associate of the company, who was also a director of PHD1, and who was previously declared bankrupt in 2010, with debts of around £1m. He now represents McInnes and the North Point Global Group. “Peter McInnes is a great promoter and he was able to convince the council that he could deliver high-quality, well-designed, mixed-use schemes on an industrial scale.” Liverpool council awarded the New Chinatown site to North Point Global in 2015, over another more established developer, X1 Ltd, despite the company having only been incorporated two months earlier.\\nNorth Point Pall Mall pictured last week\\nDavid Choules was another founding director of North Point Global, and later chaired the company, while at the same time his firm Inca was employed to certify expenditure on the firm’s developments. Buyers have pointed to what they believe to be a clear conflict of interest, with the same person certifying work for funds to be released, while also standing to receive those funds.\\nChoules denies any conflict and says he has been open and transparent at all times and that his colleague handled the day-to-day certification of works. He says he resigned from North Point Global in July 2016 “to avoid any perceived conflicts.”\\nJailed gangsters\\nOff-plan sales boomed and it all seemed to be going well, until Peter McInnes made headlines in March 2017, when his name was referred to in a court case about a notorious pair of jailed Liverpool gangsters, Stephen and Peter Clarke, in a hearing at Preston Crown Court. “He fronts companies, runs them until accounts are due and then scraps them and then moves on,” said DC Duncan Watson, financial investigator for the Cumbria constabulary, said of McInnes, adding that he didn’t know how someone like this “could be taken on by a council”.\\nMcInnes has fiercely denied the claims, saying he had not been represented in court to respond to the allegations, and that he had never been arrested, questioned or charged over money laundering in relation to any matter. Beilin bats away the accusations of criminal behaviour, but says such associations shouldn’t be surprising: “Liverpool is a small place. Behind every developer there’s a former relationship, friendship or businesses agreement with someone who isn’t totally savoury.”\\nI do feel sorry for them. But if a Romanian property roadshow came to the UK, I would not buy an off-plan apartment Sam Beilin of North Point Global\\n“The council is often attracted to partners who they think will be beneficial to them in the short term,” he adds, “but who turn out not to do them any favours in the long run. They really thought McInnes could deliver, but perhaps they didn’t do as much due diligence as they could have done in investigating the financial capacity of North Point Global.”\\nLiverpool City Council insists that proper due diligence was undertaken and that the developer was chosen on the basis of the ability to conclude a commercial deal in a timely fashion, the quality of the scheme submitted, and evidence of a wider strategy for the regeneration of the Chinatown area.\\nOnce buyers’ deposits had been secured, the New Chinatown project quickly began to unravel. As with Angelgate, it turned out that PHD1 had grossly undervalued the construction costs of the ambitious designs. The firm went into administration in April 2016, with debts of over £14m, including £7.8m owed to subcontractors. The building work on North Point Global’s sites was then taken on by the BILT group, which had been established just two months earlier. All the BILT firms went into liquidation one year after they were formed, with combined debts of £1.8m. Subcontractors told Construction Enquirer that they were not paid for their work.\\nIn July 2017, North Point Global announced it was halting work entirely and would seek to dispose of all of its sites, blaming the situation on adverse media coverage and the behaviour of the Liverpool City Council, which had publicly stated that it had reported the developer to the National Crime Agency. A spokesman for North Point Global said in a statement: “It would be wholly unrealistic to return to site on any of their projects as they consider that the brand has become tainted and damaged beyond salvage.” They insist that the company has never been contacted by the NCA or any other law enforcement agency.\\nMost of its building sites have stood untouched for 18 months, the concrete frames and exposed foundations standing as rotting monuments to the developer’s greed, investors’ naivety and mayoral hubris. The Banksy murals, including the 12-metre high Liverpool Rat and Love Plane, which were promised to return to public display, have been sold for £3.2m to an anonymous buyer in Qatar.\\nAfter months of uncertainty, it was announced this week that the New Chinatown site will be taken on by a new developer, which plans to resume work by the summer. “Our funding model will also be significantly different,” says Neal Hunter of Great George Street Developments. “We are engaging with major institutional investors to fund the scheme, rather than being reliant on multiple small investors.”\\nThe other sites will be sold, with “whatever money left divided back pro-rata to the buyers,” says Beilin. Given the number of creditors queuing up, to whom North Point Global owes almost £4.2m, the chances of investors seeing their money back are slim.\\n“I do feel sorry for them,” Beilin adds. “Whenever there’s a failure, there’s always a tendency to look for someone to take responsibility. But, when the buyers signed those sales contracts, I don’t think they actually understood what they were signing.”\\nHe adds bluntly: “If a Romanian property roadshow came to the UK, I would not buy a fractional off-plan apartment and if I did I would not pay more than a nominal deposit until it was built.”\\nThe victims\\nSitting in a cafe in Hong Kong’s Causeway Bay, one Baltic House buyer recalls the extravagant events where North Point Global’s projects were unveiled with dazzling models and presentations about Liverpool’s booming economy.\\n“We were wined and dined, and taken for celebratory banquets with Peter McInnes and Gary Millar,” says Mr Cheung. “It was presented as a council-backed project, and we were told it was a low-risk investment.” At the first promotional roadshow, Cheung was convinced to buy three units in Baltic House, followed by another three a month later. One year on, he was persuaded by promises of ever-higher yields to buy six more. “They even funded travel costs for us to come and see the site in Liverpool, so it all felt legitimate,” he says.\\nPromises v reality: how the schemes were sold – and what they look like now Read more\\nOne Hong Kong sales agent who was involved in promoting New Chinatown, before his company withdrew from the deal over unpaid fees, recalls the lavish roadshows. “Every few months they would turn up in Hong Kong and have a big yeehaw blow-out to say thank you to the buyers,” he says.\\nAcross town, another buyer tells how he remortgaged his home in Hong Kong in order to invest in three units in New Chinatown, Baltic House and the Element in Manchester, paying 80% upfront. “Gary Millar told us these were big, important projects for the whole country, that’s why I was convinced to go for it,” says Mr Chan, who had retired but is now looking for work again. “I loved the British system, but this experience has changed my opinion.”\\nIf you have been affected by the development schemes described and would like to pass on information in confidence, you can send a message via the Guardian’s SecureDrop service (see how here).\\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Another seven items, Jones added, were deemed “Highly Personal.”\\nJones’s report covers only a small part of the materials seized in April from Cohen, which includes more than a dozen mobile devices and 19 other digital-media devices. Todd Harrison, a lawyer for Cohen, told the court last week that his firm had received about 3.7 million files, with about 1.3 million already turned over to Jones for her review.\\nIn a report filed last week, Jones said the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York had received its first batch of the information, including nearly 300,000 “items.” Her report did not specify what an “item” was – though it’s likely to include a photo, video file or email message.\\nJones, a former U.S. District Court judge in Manhattan, was appointed in April to lead the review process of the FBI-seized materials after lawyers for Cohen, Trump and the Trump Organization demanded the court ensure any legally privileged attorney-client communications didn’t end up in the hands of federal prosecutors who are examining Cohen’s business affairs.\\nThat investigation, being led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York, encompasses potential fraud charges against Cohen, as well as examining his role in arranging a $130,000 payment before the 2016 presidential election to the adult-film actress Stormy Daniels to get her to remain silent about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

We also know that on many occasions, these women were in care themselves as children. Approximately one in four birth mothers in family court proceedings will reappear with a subsequent child, and recent research suggests 58% of these mothers will have experienced sexual abuse.\\n\\u200bThe young mothers trapped in a cycle of having babies removed Read more\\nBut we also know that nearly half of women in this predicament can, at a later stage, care for a child appropriately. Improvements in their mental health and growing maturity can enable them to become successful carers. So could the whole painful process of having a child removed have been avoided?\\nAs our family courts have contracted through the age of austerity and the number of care proceedings has increased by 27% over the last four years, the system is failing to cope.\\nThe arithmetic is scary too. The average cost of a looked-after child in my borough is £57,000 per year. If the average length of care is 3.6 years, this means that the cost of each child in care is more than £200,000. Where children are long-term fostered or adopted, the costs are more than triple that figure.\\nAcross the country, grant-funded schemes are trying to break this cycle; so-called Pause programmes support women who may become recurrent mothers, or care leavers who become pregnant and may be in danger of losing their child. Some schemes encourage women to take long lasting contraception. I have mixed feelings about the use of long lasting contraception contraception with women in these circumstances.\\nWe teach techniques to support their parenting – and other approaches to deal with mental health issues and drug abuse\\nIn Calderdale, we’re running a Positive Choices programme to support families. Unqualified family support workers, supervised by a social worker, are assigned to vulnerable women who are pregnant and at risk of having a child removed. They are shown techniques to support their parenting and other approaches to deal with mental health issues and drug abuse. Support is also given where there is or has been domestic violence in the household. After one year, we have helped nine women. Two cases have failed, with the children now in care, but seven have apparently been successful; the children are safe and not in need of removal to protect them.\\nRecently I had the opportunity to talk to some of the women involved in the programme to ask them what had worked for them.\\nThe first (and possibly most remarkable) thing was that the young women were with their children at the meeting – and although they were engaged in a focused conversation with me, they gave their children almost continuous attention and eye contact. These mothers all came from challenging backgrounds: mental health problems, domestic violence and drug and alcohol abuse dominated their histories, but they were all prepared to describe their previous lifestyles – and they had clearly faced up to and understood their demons.\\nThey all described being taught to look at the impact of their behaviour – their previous negative behaviour and their now positive behaviour – and the impact they had on their child’s development. They had ameliorated their behaviour and developed empathy with their child, understanding how their actions affected emotional wellbeing. For some, there was no way to mimic their own parents’ positive parenting traits as such influences had been absent from their childhoods.\\nCan new partnership keep vulnerable children out of care? Read more\\nI was humbled by their descriptions of the family support input from the programme: two pre-arranged visits each week plus one unannounced visit to their home, sometimes at the most unexpected times. The women seemed to accept this intrusion into their lives on the grounds that their children come first. Putting up with a little inconvenience to confirm the quality of their parenting seemed like a small price to pay.\\nA fair, firm and caring relationship between the woman and their key worker was also important. I heard of staff who were prepared to drop everything and call in when challenges arose, sometimes during evenings, weekends, annual leave and even during maternity leave. Visits, texts and calls were always possible and were massively appreciated.\\nThe Positive Choices programme probably costs the public about £12,000 per case per year, so is proving to reduce costs when it is successful. And if we can manage to keep breaking the cycle of mothers having children taken into care, the human benefits will be immeasurable.\\nStuart Smith is adults and children’s services director in Calderdale and board member with Cafcass\\nJoin the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

Mueller then suggested he could issue a subpoena that would compel the president to appear before a grand jury.\\n“This isn’t some game,” John Dowd, Trump’s former lead attorney, replied. “You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States.”\\nDowd later confirmed the encounter and his comments to Reuters.\\nThe special counsel’s office has been negotiating the terms of any sit-down with Trump and his legal team amid the president’s own public assertions that he was “looking forward” to the interview. Dowd was among those urging Trump to reject the request, apparently over concerns that Trump has a tendency to go off-script, which could lead him to make false statements.\\nThe New York Times on Monday published a list of questions Mueller hopes to ask Trump, a list that was compiled by Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow as part of those negotiations. Many of the open-ended queries focus on potential efforts to obstruct justice through the firings of FBI Director James Comey or attempts to fire the special counsel himself.\\nDowd, upon hearing of Mueller’s line of inquiry, was further convinced that Trump should refuse an interview, the Times reported. He resigned from his role in March after the president appeared poised to reject his advice.\\nDowd was replaced last month by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\\nTrump on Tuesday condemned the release of the questions on Twitter and asserted that there were “no questions about collusion,” even though some do appear on the list.\\n“Oh, I see...you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information.

That is, until they consider the potential side effects of using public sector muscle to rein in the pharmaceutical industry.\\nA new POLITICO-Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health poll finds that Republicans and Democrats alike overwhelmingly support the idea of drastic government action on drug prices — with 9 out of 10 in favor of handing Medicare the power to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers.\\nStory Continued Below\\nBut that bipartisan enthusiasm falters when Americans are confronted with the negative trade-offs tied to forcing prices lower, a finding that helps explain why lawmakers may have an easier time railing against skyrocketing drug prices than actually doing anything about them.\\n“This only suggests that this is a tempting issue for political people in both parties because it’s so popular,” said Robert Blendon, a Harvard professor of health policy and political analysis who designed the poll. “They’re going to find it much more controversial if they can’t answer the question of how you protect consumers from the potential downside.”\\nSupport for Medicare negotiations with drug-makers, for example, dropped from 90 percent to just 42 percent when respondents weighed the risk that some pharmaceutical companies might respond by halting the sale of certain drugs to seniors. And while 80 percent favored limiting the price of drugs sold to state health programs, only 38 percent still liked the idea if it meant drug companies would spend less on research and development.\\nThose views were largely uniform across the political spectrum, reflecting the growing pressure on Washington to tackle drug prices. But it also shows the potency of the deep-pocketed pharmaceutical industry\\'s arguments against government intervention.\\n“The industry is not going to do it because the industry is out to make money,” said Wendi Games, a New York Democrat who participated in the poll, of the need to tamp down drug prices. “It has to be a federal law, where the government gets involved.”\\nPresident Donald Trump has vowed to go after pharmaceutical companies he’s accused of “getting away with murder,” at one point siding with Democrats in favoring direct negotiating power for Medicare. However, his administration has backed off the idea, and is instead pushing for incremental changes aimed at creating more competition among drug companies and lowering patients\\' out-of-pocket costs.\\nBeyond drug pricing, the POLITICO-Harvard poll suggests the Trump administration could still find public traction in expanding access to experimental medicines for very sick patients.\\nNearly 70 percent of Americans — with similar levels of support across party lines — like the idea of letting terminally ill patients seek new drugs that haven’t been fully tested, even after considering it could hurt patients or undermine the development of new drugs.\\n“It’s not going to harm them any worse than they already are,” said Nancy Fillip, an Illinois nurse and Republican who participated in the poll. \"I can tell you that I would do anything for my patient to get better, and if a drug might make somebody live six months longer, that’s six months their family has.”\\nHowever, the poll didn’t ask specifically about the “right-to-try” legislation Trump endorsed earlier this year and that failed in a House vote on Tuesday. Opponents of the measure point out that FDA already allows patients access to experimental medicines with its approval; the right-to-try bill, however, would let patients bypass the agency.\\nDespite bipartisan agreement on pharmaceutical issues, Americans remain deeply divided on Obamacare after a year of GOP efforts to repeal the law.\\nHalf said the health care law is working about the same as a year ago, compared with 31 percent who believe it’s deteriorated and just 12 percent who think it has improved on the Trump administration’s watch.\\nAmong those who believe the law is worsening, Republicans disproportionately blame congressional Democrats, while Democrats blame Trump and Republicans. Independents, meanwhile, spread the blame around a little more evenly, though most blame congressional Democrats.\\nEven though congressional Republicans managed to effectively wipe out the unpopular individual mandate, it hasn’t translated to warmer feelings about the law among the party’s voters. Half of Republicans said Obamacare is actually working worse than a year ago, versus just 10 percent of Democrats and one-third of independents.\\n“It’s a mess,” said Fillip, the Illinois nurse, who blamed Democrats and hard-line conservatives for the GOP’s failure last year to repeal and replace the law. “Nobody would come together, and that’s what makes me so mad about Congress.”\\nThe few changes Republicans have made, such as wiping out the mandate penalty or pushing cheaper alternatives to Obamacare plans, haven’t yet pierced the public’s consciousness, Blendon said.\\nMuch of the GOP rhetoric of the past year centered on repealing Obamacare entirely in order to stave off an insurance market collapse. That’s made it difficult now for Republicans to alter individual parts of Obamacare and convince voters those smaller victories will make a huge difference.\\n“A large share of people really either are now aware of them or don’t think these changes are having much of an impact,” Blendon said. “Looking back at their last year, they don’t see big changes.”\\nThis article tagged under: Health Care\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Puzzled by the claim that biology is imaginary yet feelings are concrete?\\nIf so, then you truly are on the path to wisdom, says Ryan Anderson, the level-headed analyst of transgender theology at the Heritage Foundation, and the author of a new book on transgender politics, titled “When Harry Became Sally.”\\nHe sketches the slippery creativity of the transgender ideology in an article, titled “Transgender Ideology Is Riddled With Contradictions. Here Are the Big Ones.” He writes:\\nAt the core of the ideology is the radical claim that feelings determine reality. From this idea come extreme demands for society to play along with subjective reality claims. Trans ideologues ignore contrary evidence and competing interests, they disparage alternative practices, and they aim to muffle skeptical voices and shut down any disagreement. The movement has to keep patching and shoring up its beliefs, policing the faithful, coercing the heretics, and punishing apostates, because as soon as its furious efforts flag for a moment or someone successfully stands up to it, the whole charade is exposed. That’s what happens when your dogmas are so contrary to obvious, basic, everyday truths. A transgender future is not the “right side of history,” yet activists have convinced the most powerful sectors of our society to acquiesce to their demands. While the claims they make are manifestly false, it will take real work to prevent the spread of these harmful ideas.\\nRead it all here.\\nThere are very few “transgender” people. For example, advocates say from 250 to several thousand people in the military are trying to live like members of the other sex in a military population of 1.3 million full-time soldiers, sailors, marines and air force personnel. Fewer than o.3 percent of Americans wish to live as members of the opposite sex.\\nPolls show that roughly one-quarter of Americans support the progressive claim that biological sex trumps chosen “gender identity,” despite intense media pressure in favor of the pro-transgender, anti-sexes campaign.\\nThe progressive push to bend Americans’ attitudes and their two-sex civic society around the idea of “gender” has already attacked and cracked popular social rules for how Americans handle the many social preferences of equal, different and complementary men and women, boys and girls.\\nFor example, the gender claims have shifted rules or practices about different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents’ rights in childrearing, practices to help teenagers, women’s expectations of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men’s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, and children’s sexual privacy.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

I can\\'t afford f****** health insurance.\"\\nThat\\'s one of the first things Larry Cagle says on the phone. He is spitting nails. The Tulsa English teacher is one of the leaders of a grassroots organizing group, Oklahoma Teachers United, that they say represents thousands of public school teachers around the state. His group, and both of Oklahoma\\'s teachers unions, support the walkout and rally happening across the state Monday in support of higher wages and more state revenue.\\nTeachers are striking even though state legislators passed a pay raise of about $6,000 last week. That vote followed earlier walkouts. The bill, if signed, would bring Oklahoma\\'s teacher salaries from among the lowest in the nation, to the middle of the pack.\\nThe Oklahoma teachers are not the only ones unhappy. Teachers in Kentucky are gathering Monday at the state capitol to press for education funding. Many schools there are on spring break, allowing teachers to travel to Frankfort. Schools not on spring break closed.\\nThis wave of teacher-led actions around the country was kicked off when teachers in West Virginia emerged victorious from a nearly two-week strike earlier this month. In Arizona, hundreds of teachers walked out last week, and there have been rumbles as far away as New Mexico and Alaska.\\nThe rally in Kentucky is led by the Kentucky Education Association, the state\\'s union affiliate. But in many other states, grassroots teachers groups, like Larry Cagle\\'s group in Oklahoma, have taken the lead — often using social media to organize.\\nArizona Educators United, a grassroots group similar to Oklahoma Teachers United, has taken the helm in that state. The union affiliate, the Arizona Education Association, has offered its full support of protest efforts. \"They\\'ve really let us drive this and steer this,\" explains Noah Karvelis, one of the organizers of Arizona Educators United.\\nIn Oklahoma, teachers like Cagle have stepped up, discontent with union leadership. Oklahoma is a right-to-work state, which means that employees don\\'t have to join the unions there. The American Federation of Teachers has about 2,700 members out of 42,000 teachers. The state\\'s other major union, the Oklahoma Education Association, says it has 40,000 members including many different kinds of school employees like bus drivers, retired teachers and education majors at Oklahoma colleges and universities.\\nThat\\'s a major reason that Cagle calls the unions \"weak and vulnerable.\" He says his group has been forced to take matters into their own hands. \"We are the only unified protest group,\" he says. Teachers represented by Cagle\\'s group want a $10,000 raise. \"We had 70 percent turnover in the last five years in my school,\" he says. \"You\\'re not going to stop that with a $6,000 raise.\"\\nIf they don\\'t get what they want, he threatens continuing protests into the summer and beyond.\\nThey\\'re also in it for the long-haul, advocating for a tax change to help pay for school funding that will be on the ballot in November.\\nEd Allen, the leader of the Oklahoma City AFT, tells NPR he\\'s never seen anything like this negotiation process in his 26 years with the union. \"Never have I ever thought\" that he\\'d be negotiating with lawmakers on the one side and teachers on the other, he says. \"How do you negotiate with Facebook?\"\\n\"We consider it a down payment,\" he said in a statement last week when his union accepted the budget deal. It\\'s a nuanced position. He tells NPR that despite the \"passionate\" voices of those on social media, \"We don\\'t see any way of getting any more money.\"\\nThat\\'s not enough, says Brendan Jarvis, a middle school geography teacher just outside of Tulsa: \"[Legislators] are not talking about anything right now that teachers are happy with.\" He\\'s a board member of the Oklahoma Education Association, the state\\'s biggest teachers union. The OEA didn\\'t accept the deal.\\nJarvis says he and other OEA members are walking out — and they\\'re planning on staying out, until a plan is passed that teachers are happy with. At his school, educators are coordinating child care plans and working to feed students if lawmakers don\\'t pass a deal that satisfies their demands.\\n\"I\\'ve never been left out in the cold,\" by the union, says Ashley Robertson, a fouth-grade teacher and OEA member in Blanchard, Okla. She\\'s attending the rally in the capitol with many of her colleagues.\\nArizona teachers are watching\\nWhen the Oklahoma senate voted last week to increase teacher pay, thousands of Arizona teachers gathered in Phoenix at the capitol. Many wore buttons that read: I don\\'t want to strike, but I will.\\nNoah Karvelis, one of the grassroots organizers of Arizona Educators United, says they want teacher pay increased by 20 percent and state education funding restored to 2008 levels. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said that won\\'t happen.\\nKarvelis, a music teacher in Tolleson, Ariz., noticed the lack of funding right away when he arrived in the state to teach two years ago.\\n\"There were days when I had more kids than chairs,\" he told NPR. Today, he has seven working keyboards to teach about 40 kids how to play piano. \"Every single kid that I\\'ve ever had deserves more than this. There are kids who are not being given a fair chance here.\"\\nKarvelis says that, once a critical mass of teachers is on board with a walkout, \"the power is in our hands.\"\\nTeachers in Arizona don\\'t have a specific legislative deadline, or a date for a walkout. But the end of the school year is quickly approaching — and the end of the legislative session is, too.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

How long can dogged Theresa May keep her job? And when will the pinstriped assassin Jacob Rees-Mogg strike next? Grab another drink, slap on the Soltan, and all shall be revealed on page 194. What larks! Yet away from parliament, and far from the tabloid front pages, a serious breach is opening up in British politics. Last week some of the most senior business leaders in Britain came out of a Brexit meeting at No 10, and promptly tore the prime minister to shreds. “We’re playing economics; [the politicians] are playing politics,” said Paul Drechsler, president of the bosses’ organisation, the Confederation of British Industry. “In the world of business, we’re frustrated. We’re angry.”\\nAn extraordinary statement, especially from an executive invited to tea and biscuits with May. If supposedly tame industrialists now talk like this, you have to wonder what sounds come out of the feral lot.\\nYet the CBI’s impatience is shared by many. Once the long-haul arm of the Tory movement, the Freight Transport Association lashed out at May last week for “playing chicken with crucial parts of the British economy and the livelihoods of … 7 million Britons”.\\nThese are close friends of the Conservative party.As one senior representative of a leading business organisation says: “Over the past two years, most company bosses would never risk saying openly that Brexit is turning out to be a disaster, in case it scared off their best staff.” With fewer than 290 days before Britain formally leaves the EU, their caution is running out.\\nThis is a far bigger story than the one on the front pages about who promised which amendment to which band of Tories. One of the fundamental relationships in the establishment is fracturing – and the consequences for government and economy could prove to be historic.\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest ‘We’re angry …’ CBI president Paul Drechsler (left) and other business leaders in Downing St last November. Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images\\nAn iron rule of British politics is that the Conservatives mean business, and business means the Conservatives. Despite an early falling-out with Margaret Thatcher and a dalliance with Tony Blair, blue remains home corner for commercial companies and champions of cutting taxes and trimming red tape to a minimum. Yet in May’s two years as prime minister, business has either been cast as the enemy or relegated to a walk-on part. In that chaotic summer of 2016, as senior Tories stabbed each other in the back and themselves in the front, May was quick to grasp that many leave voters were sticking up two fingers at the British way of doing capitalism. Neither an ex-banker nor marinaded in Treasury culture, she happily blasted “unscrupulous bosses” and “corporate irresponsibility”. Among her aides was the enthusiastic leaver, Nick Timothy, whose masterplan was to use Brexit to win over working-class voters who had been chucked overboard by New Labour.\\nOnce in No 10, May’s schemes for putting workers on company boards and blocking Chinese funding of British nuclear plants turned to dust. Yet on the central policy issue of our time, business remains stuck in a non-speaking role.\\nQuick guide What is the EU withdrawal bill? Show Hide What is the EU withdrawal bill? The EU Withdrawal Bill – once known as the Great Repeal Bill – is going through the House of Commons to repeal the 1972 European Communities Act and transpose all existing EU legislation into domestic UK law, which will avoid a \\'cliff-edge\\' change on the day after we leave the EU. Parts of the bill have been highly controversial, and MPs have tabled hundreds of amendments to try and change its wording, including a significant number of Conservative rebels. Some of the key controversies include its use of so-called Henry VIII powers, which will give government ministers the power to tweak the wording of laws to make sure they make sense in UK legislation - but those changes could take place without having to go through parliament. MPs have called this a \"power grab\" by the government. The government estimates around 800 to 1,000 measures called statutory instruments will be required to make sure the bill is applied correctly. Other concerns include the government\\'s decision not to include the EU charter of fundamental rights in the law being transposed. Other amendments are attempts to affect the Brexit process, including legislating for a transitional period and giving MPs a binding meaningful vote on the deal secured by Theresa May, before the deal is finalised.\\nTake the all-important triggering of article 50: May announced it in her first conference speech as leader, just weeks after the referendum vote and before parliament had resumed. Forget about consulting industry and finance: she didn’t even give them notice.\\nAfter last summer’s election debacle, and Timothy’s exit, May’s new team set up a conciliatory business advisory council that meets in Downing Street every three months or so. A long way short of the Brexit business task force called for by the CBI and others, its rotating membership – one month WPP, the next Rolls-Royce – makes it almost useless as a forum for formal input. Unsurprisingly, it was after one of these council meetings that Drechsler exploded.\\nMinisters and aides try to calm the waters. Their efforts, while appreciated by people in business I have spoken to, are rendered void against the bungling and botching that marks the negotiations. The tens of billions taxpayers give business in subsidies and tax reliefs are now taken for granted. For as long as Brexit is treated by May first and foremost as a way to keep her own cabinet and party together, the private sector will remain frozen out. Anything else it would like – from a third runway at Heathrow to a proper industrial strategy – gets parked on the long list marked “any other business”.\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Cameron visits Jaguar Land Rover in Solihull, June 2016. Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images\\nImagine you are a senior manager at a major carmaker. Over the past two years, you have been assured that you would continue to “operate within” the European single market. Except that turned into “frictionless” trade – which then became “as frictionless as possible”. Meanwhile, the cabinet dreams up “customs partnerships” and other unicorns destined only to be waved away by Michel Barnier – and Boris Johnson is wittering on about yet another bloody bridge. How are you meant to plan around any of that? The answer is that the worst-case scenarios your team drew up in 2016 are, by 2018, your base case.\\nNo longer is it just banks and pharmaceutical firms looking overseas. Britain’s biggest car manufacturer, Jaguar Land Rover, warned this week it would shift production of its Discovery 4x4 from Solihull to EU member Slovakia. That can be explained away as focusing Midlands staff on making electric cars – but just last September, the firm said its presence in Slovakia was a “hedge” against Brexit uncertainty.\\nBusiness must speak up, and save Britain from Brexit | Polly Toynbee Read more\\nThe problem this poses for the rest of us is very real and very easy to sum up. Among all the 28 members of the EU, the UK ranks second only to Ireland on its level of inward investment. As Kevin Farnsworth at the University of York points out, from Thatcher onwards, British governments have touted for capital investment from abroad. It’s why George Osborne cut corporation tax so low and went on tours of China and India. It’s also why the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, says the UK relies on “the kindness of strangers”. That dependence has grown as Britain has lost more and more of its own businesses and become instead a branch-plant economy for the rest of the world. And that kindness is now being strained by a blundering Brexit. Soon the headlines will be not just about a few hundred jobs moving out of the City – but of firms scrapping their expansion plans, or factories shifting to Poland, or thousands of jobs going at a stroke of a pen.\\nIt was always a rotten and unsafe model. The irony is, it is a Conservative government that now appears intent on tearing it down – with nothing to replace it. In place of a strategy, you get the panic that broke out in Downing Street when Nissan threatened to take its money elsewhere – resulting in a private meeting with the Japanese carmaker and a series of promises made in a secret “comfort letter”. This is no more an economic policy than a bunch of flowers bought at a service station is a Valentine’s present.\\nBut then, this has been the decade in which the political and policymaking elite has inflicted upon itself wound after wound. First came the fiasco of austerity, and an economy that refused to bounce back as Osborne and Carney promised it would. Then came the Brexit referendum that Cameron claimed he had in the bag. And that has produced the slow dissolution of the Tory-corporate coalition central to contemporary British capitalism.\\nWith all that as the background, why wouldn’t you opt for a bit of beach-reading escapism?\\n• Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist and senior economics commentator\\n\\n### Response:\\nThere are no explicit causal chains mentioned in the given text.\\n\\n### End', 'Below is an excerpt from a news article.

Syrian state television claimed that early Monday morning that airstrikes targeted an air base in Homs , a strategic staging ground for Russian and Syrian forces. The Pentagon said it wasn\\'t involved in any strikes in Syria, and Russia says the Israelis sent two F-15 fighter jets into Syrian airspace and launched eight missiles at the T-4 air base. The Russian Defense Ministry claims \"Syrian air defense units\" shot down five of the guided missiles.\\nThe US President may find it problematic to deliver consequences in a conflict he has worked to shed any responsibility for. Last week, while he told the world he wanted to withdraw American troops from northern Syria , the three world leaders largely behind Assad\\'s survival met to discuss the way forward as they saw it. There was no American presence as the leaders of Turkey, Iran and Russia met , and no indication that the US would be included in discussions in the future.\\nThere appeared to be little the President could actually do. On Sunday, he took to Twitter to shift the blame for the events in Syria to his predecessor, Barack Obama.\\n\"If President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line In The Sand, the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago! Animal Assad would have been history!\" Trump posted on Twitter\\n\"OK, Barack Obama made some mistakes,\" said Fawaz Gerges , a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. \"Is President Trump committed? Does he have the desire and the will to basically become engaged in Syria? This is the question,\" he told CNN.\\nUnilaterally forfeiting American influence\\nTrump came into office determined to undo many of Obama\\'s policies, dissolve treaties he deemed against American interests and eager to avoid being drawn into conflicts abroad that he\\'d argued were costly and unnecessary.\\nBut months in, Trump authorized his own military strike against a Syrian government air base after a chemical weapons attack killed dozens of civilians earlier in the city of Khan Sheikhoun. US warships launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at the base that was headquarters for the warplanes that carried out the chemical attacks.\\nTrump\\'s decision at the time was viewed as a dramatic shift in his position on the presence of American troops in Syria. Footage showing \"innocent babies\" killed by chemical gas, \"crosses many, many lines. Beyond a red line, many, many lines,\" Trump said then.\\nJUST WATCHED Trump: Putin, Iran responsible for backing Assad Replay More Videos ...

He\\'s reportedly unhappy with the amount of money the US was spending in the region, and has questioned the results of that expenditure. But after tense discussions with his national security team, he\\'s agreed to hold off on ordering the withdrawal.\\nThat decision has \"unilaterally forfeited any American influence in helping shape Syria\\'s future,\" Fawaz Gerges told CNN. \"Trump\\'s fateful decision will reinforce the widespread perception, among both friends and foes of the United States, that America is in retreat in Syria and beyond, unwilling to shoulder the burden of global leadership. It is also an explicit acknowledgment that the United States and its Syrian allies have lost the war.\"\\nAn unresolvable conundrum\\nOstensibly, the United States has been in Syria for years now to battle elements of the Islamic State. Its troops had allied with Kurdish militias and other partners on the ground (in Iraq it was the Iraqi army and Shiite militias) to wrest back territory seized by the extremists across a swath of Iraq and Syria.\\nFrom early on, the Obama administration chose to distinguish its fight in Syria as focused largely against ISIS, and maintained its position regarding the Syrian regime to be in line with sanctions and pressure from the international community, but without any military leverage.\\n\"US policy toward Syria has been debilitated by an irresolvable conundrum. While the US has led the fight against ISIS, in the broader Syrian context, it has been a secondary player reacting to adversaries who ignored the mantra that \\'there is no military solution in Syria,\\'\" wrote Emile Hokayem and Karim Sadjadpour at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\\nJUST WATCHED Trump doing what he bashed Obama for Replay More Videos ...

His steadfastness has earned him visits from other Arab leaders who were disappointed with the Obama administration\\'s support of Arab revolutions that unseated their cohorts. America\\'s ebbing influence from the international scene has allowed Putin to assume a larger role and greater influence that he has emphasized in his ties to the Syrian regime.\\n\"Russia has history, a defense pact, and close political relations with Damascus. Iran has more recent strategic links, growing commercial interests, and controls thousands of pro-Tehran militias in addition to its own troops across the country,\" said Rodger Shanahan at the Lowy Institute in Australia.

In January, he said it was the last time he was issuing a waiver denoting that Iran was complying with the agreement. He said he was doing so \"only in order to secure our European allies\\' agreement to fix the terrible flaws\" of the deal. He warned the US would not \"again waive sanctions in order to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. If at any time I judge that such an agreement is not within reach, I will withdraw from the deal immediately.\"\\n\"With President Trump\\'s nearing his decision on the nuclear agreement with Iran, there is a real and present danger that Syria will become the battleground for an even more dangerous conflagration than the war that is continuing on its torturous route,\" noted the LSE\\'s Fawaz Gerges.\\nJUST WATCHED Two years of Trump panning the Iran deal Replay More Videos ...

President Donald Trump has proposed tariffs on aerospace, machinery, and information and communications technology products imported from China. Beijing swiftly replied with its own tariffs on U.S. fruits, wine, steel pipe and pork, among other goods.\\nHere at home, some industries are particularly at risk. That\\'s because companies in these sectors not only import parts and materials from China, but also often export finished products there as well.\\nThere are three primary mechanisms by which U.S. tariffs on China could hurt American companies. Tariffs on Chinese imports would increase the cost of raw materials for U.S. businesses, forcing them to pay more to make the same goods, whether cars, appliances or electronics. China\\'s reciprocal tariffs make U.S. goods more expensive for Chinese consumers, hurting the many businesses trying their luck in the world\\'s largest market.\\nFinally, China could make it hard for American companies to do business using other methods, such as increasing regulations on U.S. companies in China or slowing down deals.\\n\"The retaliation could turn into dissuading Chinese consumers and Chinese businesses from buying U.S. products and brands,\" Keith Parker, a strategist at UBS, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There\\'s lots of things that can be done, if trade tensions were to escalate, whether it\\'s influencing purchasing decisions or making exports to the U.S. more difficult.\"\\nTechnology and electronics\\nU.S. technology companies rank particularly high on the list of potential losers because many of them are exposed in multiple ways: They rely on Chinese suppliers, and they sell to Chinese companies. UBS, which compiled a list of public companies with significant sales in China, noted that cell phones, computer equipment, semiconductors and clothing were potentially the most vulnerable products if Beijing chooses to hit back.\\n\"All iPhones come out of China,\" said Jeff Fieldhack, an analyst at Counterpoint Research. \"And other U.S. companies, even if their R&D and development is here in the U.S., they\\'re still making their parts and assembly in China.\"\\nApple (AAPL) is exposed to China in several ways: It relies on Chinese factories for assembly; China has an effective lock on the rare-earth minerals essential for Apple products; and China\\'s fast-growing middle class is increasingly important for Apple\\'s consumer strategy. Some 20 percent of Apple\\'s sales last year were in China.\\n\"China is the biggest market to over 100 countries. It\\'s hard to find another country with that kind of demand,\" said Ann Lee, a former professor at Peking University and author of \"Why China\\'s Economy Collapsed.\" \"If the U.S. goes forward, you could see blowback that could hurt companies and workers.\"\\nBoeing\\nBoeing (BA) stock, which plunged when the U.S. announced steel and aluminum tariffs in February, continued to drop Wednesday, reflecting the company\\'s vulnerability to international tensions.\\nChina has unique leverage because it buys so many of Boeing\\'s planes. It signed a deal to buy 300 Boeing planes during Mr. Trump\\'s fall visit to the country. Over the next two decades, China is projected to order around $1 trillion worth of aircraft, according to Bloomberg.\\nAfter the U.S., \"China is the largest market for Boeing aircraft in the world; it\\'s about 20-25 percent of aircraft deliveries every year,\" said Chris Higgins, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. \"They don\\'t really need to enact tariffs to retaliate on Boeing; all they need to do is shift purchases to Airbus.\"\\n\"If they announce a large order for Airbus aircraft tomorrow, that would send a message,\" he added.\\nA lesser risk is the rising cost of metal itself. Because aircraft are made primarily of steel and aluminum, an increase in those costs would ding its profit margins. Aluminum, which makes up nearly 80 percent of an airplane\\'s body weight, is set to get 10 percent pricier after the tariffs.\\nBut the industry is relatively used to volatile commodity prices, said Higgins -- aluminum prices rose nearly 25 percent last year with \"hardly a peep\" from the aerospace industry. (Steel, while it\\'s subject to heavier 25 percent tariffs, makes up only about 10 percent of an airplane\\'s weight.)\\nSoybeans\\nSome of the fiercest opposition to tariffs is coming from a sector that has, so far, been spared retaliation: soybeans. Soybean farmers sent $14 billion of crops to China last year and see themselves as a prime target for countermeasures.\\n\"We\\'re very concerned about the type of retaliation we might get,\" said Wayne Fredericks, who grows soybeans and corn on 750 acres in northern Iowa. \"The soybean industry is sitting in the bull\\'s eye of Chinese retaliatory efforts.\"\\nWayne Fredericks\\nChina is the biggest customer for U.S. soybeans, buying one-third of our soybean crop last year. That number, which has increased exponentially over the last 15 years, is driven by the Chinese middle class\\' growing appetite for meat. The soybeans are pressed and used for animal feed and, to a lesser degree, for cooking oil.\\n\"As income levels have risen in China, diets have shifted more and more to meat consumption,\" said Joseph Glauber, senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute. \"They\\'ve modernized their pork and poultry production, so it looks a lot like the U.S., and they feed them much like we do in the U.S.\" -- that is to say, with soybeans and corn. Sorghum and barley have also benefited from this growth to a lesser degree.\\nFor its part, China has accused the U.S. government of unfairly subsidizing the soybean industry to flood the markets (the very same tactic of which Mr. Trump accuses the Chinese.)\\n\"Certainly these issues are not new,\" said Kirk Leeds, director of business development for the Iowa Soybean Association (ISA). \"What appears to be different is the Trump administration is taking what appears to be a much more aggressive position. That makes many of us nervous.\"\\nLeeds, who is leading an ISA delegation on a two-week trip to China, spoke to CBS News from a high-speed train between Beijing and Wuhan. His group had just met with the U.S. ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, who is also Iowa\\'s former governor.\\n\"I think the next couple weeks could be critical,\" he said. \"Everyone is aware over here, everyone\\'s paying attention to us and most [people] are hoping that there will be a firm resolution.\"\\nFinancial firms\\nIn October, China loosened regulations on foreign ownership of Chinese banks, a step the U.S. finance industry lauded as historic. With the U.S. contemplating tariffs—not to mention knocking down Chinese ownership of U.S. companies—observers worry China could reverse its steps.\\n\"That was a huge offer from the Chinese, and that could completely go down the drain with these kinds of tariffs,\" said Lee. \"The Chinese will say, \\'Why should we be bending over backwards when you don\\'t want to establish a stronger relationship?\\'\"\\nIn nearly all other sectors, Chinese rules on foreign companies remain famously strict (a fact that Mr. Trump highlighted on Thursday).\\n\"U.S. companies, tech companies and high-value-add companies are in essence forced to partner with a domestic producer in China. That\\'s one area where policymakers could tighten the screws,\" said Peter Donisanu, investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo.\\nWith higher barriers to ownership, U.S. companies could conclude it\\'s easier to sell their share of an enterprise and essentially exit the Chinese market.\\nHard bargain\\nGiven the potential of tariffs to hurt hundreds of U.S. businesses, many analysts are choosing to see Thursday\\'s announcement not as the last word, but rather as an opening gambit aimed at bringing China to the bargaining table.\\n\"For now this seems to be about renegotiating trade deals,\" said Donisanu, citing the examples of steel and aluminum tariffs, which were watered down significantly before they even came into effect.\\nBut even if the final tariffs are small numerically, a prolonged negotiation between the U.S. and China could have other consequences. Decisions about supply chains, factories, hiring and firing can take years to fully play out. In the meantime, American industry has two weeks to press the case for particular tariffs—and to fret about the results.\\n\"Maybe in a few years we can look back and say, as convoluted as this strategy is, it was beneficial for the U.S.,\" said Fredericks, the soybean farmer. \"But the process is pretty painful.\"\\nJillian Harding and Rachel Layne contributed reporting.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Tom Garrett and his wife turned the congressman’s staff into personal servants, multiple former employees to the freshman Republican told POLITICO — assigning them tasks from grocery shopping to fetching the congressman’s clothes to caring for their pet dog, all during work hours.\\nPOLITICO has spoken with four former staffers who detailed a deeply dysfunctional office, where the congressman and his wife, Flanna, often demanded that staff run personal errands outside their typical congressional duties. The couple called on staff to pick up groceries, chauffeur Garrett’s daughters to and from his Virginia district, and fetch clothes that the congressman forgot at his Washington apartment. They were even expected to watch and clean up after Sophie, their Jack Russell-Pomeranian mix, the aides said.\\nStory Continued Below\\nThe staffers said they feared that if they refused Garrett‘s or his wife’s orders — both were known for explosive tempers — they would struggle to advance in their careers. It wasn't just full-time staff: many of the allegedly inappropriate requests were made of interns, the former aides said.\\n“I didn’t know who I was working for: Was I working for him? Was I working for her?” said one of those staffers who, like others interviewed for this story, asked not to be named for fear of retribution. “We became their gofers.”\\nA spokesman for Garrett, Matt Missen, declined to address a detailed list of complaints about the office.\\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\\n“We see no reason to respond to anonymous, unfounded allegations primarily targeting Congressman Garrett’s wife, made by POLITICO’s ‘unnamed’ sources,” he said. “It is easy to spread untruths and even easier to exaggerate and imply wrongdoing when none exists.”\\nThe behind-the-scenes turmoil boiled over Tuesday evening, when Garrett’s chief of staff, Jimmy Keady, abruptly parted ways with the congressman. His exit, multiple sources say, came amid a dispute with Garrett over the couple’s alleged misuse of official resources. Multiple sources raised the issue with the congressman, and senior staffers tried to rectify the situation repeatedly.\\nOn Wednesday, Garrett, a 46-year-old Army veteran and former state senator, began telling associates that he was considering not running for reelection — stunning Republicans in Virginia and Washington. But a day later, he reversed course, saying during a rambling 30-minute news conference that he would in fact seek another term.\\n“There is no way in heck that I’m not going to be back here in 2019 as a member of the Congress representing the 5th District of Virginia. Too darn much is at stake,” Garrett told reporters.\\nMuch of the controversy stemmed from Garrett’s wife, Flanna, a frequent presence in his House office. Former staffers said she comes to work with him on most weekdays.\\nEarly in his tenure, staffers say, Flanna began asking aides to perform what they considered to be tasks that were unofficial and personal in nature. One staffer recalled an instance in which he had been asked to pick her up from the grocery store, drive her to the couple’s apartment and help her unload groceries. Tom Garrett was at a baseball game and was unable to help, the staffer was told at the time.\\nGarrett also had staffers run errands for him. From time to time, two former staffers recalled, the congressman would arrive to work having forgotten to wear a belt or with a stain on his shirt, they said. Garrett, they said, would dispatch aides to his apartment to pick up fresh clothes for him.\\nAides also grew acquainted with the couple’s dog, who often came to the office with the Garretts. Staffers were expected to watch the dog during office hours, and one aide did so over a weekend. Several aides said the couple would sometimes seem to forget the dog was in the office. When that happened, at the end of the day, aides were responsible for transporting it back to Garrett’s Washington apartment.\\nOne source said the dog occasionally defecated on the floor and aides had to clean up the mess.\\nAides also served as drivers for the congressman’s older daughters from a previous marriage, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter. Interns or other staffers were sent to Scottsdale, Virginia, where the two lived in Garrett’s district, to pick them up and bring them to Washington. Scottsdale is a three-hour drive from D.C.\\nGarrett’s conduct could raise ethics concerns. The House Ethics manual prohibits lawmakers from using staff for anything other than official congressional duties. Members are explicitly barred from instructing aides to do personal errands in the manual, which also recounts situations in which staff were wrongly told to fetch personal mail, clean a member’s home and pay a member’s bills.\\nMissen said there is “no ethics investigation” into the office and that “to ensure that all staff follow the rules, Congressman Garrett has had lawyers from the House Ethics Committee meet with him and his staff (to include district staff via telephone) to brief everyone on the ethics rules pertaining to congressmen and staff, and to answer any questions.”\\nStaffer say the atmosphere in the office was toxic, however, and the demands were far outside what should reasonably be expected of congressional aides. Flanna would reach out to aides at all hours of the night, according to two former staffers. One person recalled an incident in which Flanna lashed out at a staffer for not picking up the congressman from his apartment after he overslept.\\nFormer aides said they were afraid to refuse Flanna’s instructions. Some said they performed them without protest because they worried they’d be fired.\\nOthers, however, left because they couldn’t take it anymore. Since taking office in January 2017, Garrett has had among the highest levels of turnover in the House, according to records compiled by legislative data company LegiStorm . More than 60 percent of his staff left in 2017, compared with the House’s typical 25 percent turnover rate that year, making the office fourth out of more than 400 legislative shops.\\n“I came aboard because I really, really believed in the message being presented and believed in Garrett as a person and as congressman,” said one the former aides. “I can take hard work. What I can’t put up with is these just mundane tasks that [were] being asked to be completed by him and his wife that had nothing to do with the job.”\\nThat same staffer said he told a senior aide that running the Garretts’ personal errands was “effed up.” The senior staffer responded that if he couldn’t handle it, this was not the job for him.\\nJust hours before his news conference on Thursday, Garrett decided he wanted one of his departed staffers back.\\nThat morning, he tried to hire back Keady, the former chief of staff who objected to the congressman’s use of office resources.\\nKeady declined the offer.\\nJohn Bresnahan contributed to this report.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

In those contacts, Strzok, who also helped run the investigation into Hillary Clinton\\'s use of a private email server, referred to Trump as an \"idiot\" and the two expressed a clear preference for the Democratic candidate.\\nMore: Peter Strzok, FBI agent removed from Robert Mueller\\'s Russia probe, called Trump an \\'idiot\\'\\nRelated: FBI agent assigned to Russia investigation removed after anti-Trump texts\\nIn all, Justice identified about 50,000 messages between the two.\\nIn a statement Monday, Sessions said the FBI had not retained messages between the two, from Dec.14, 2016 to May 17, 2017, the day Mueller was appointed to lead Justice\\'s inquiry into Russia interference in the 2016 election.\\nMueller\\'s appointment followed Sessions\\' decision to recuse himself from overseeing that matter because he failed to disclose pre-election meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\\nA number of congressional panels have requested the text communications between Strzok and Page to examine whether Mueller\\'s investigation was biased against Trump. The texts were first discovered this summer by the Justice Department\\'s inspector general who is in the midst of a wide-ranging review of the department\\'s handling of the Clinton investigation.\\n“The department apprised the congressional committees of the missing text messages on Friday,\" Sessions said. \"I have spoken to the inspector general and a review is already underway to ascertain what occurred and to determine if these records can be recovered in any other way. If any wrongdoing were to be found to have caused this gap, appropriate legal disciplinary action measures will be taken.\\n“We will leave no stone un-turned to confirm with certainty why these text messages are not now available to be produced and will use every technology available to determine whether the missing messages are recoverable from another source,\" Sessions said.\\nRepublican lawmakers have seized on the text communications to question the credibility of Mueller\\'s continuing inquiry and to call for a second special counsel to examine the FBI\\'s handling of the matter.\\nIn a statement Monday, the Republican chairmen of three influential House panels--the Intelligence, Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees--called the missing communications \"concerning.\"\\nThe missing messages, the chairmen said, represent a \"critical gap encompassing the FBI\\'s Russia investigation.\"\\nContributing: Erin Kelly\\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2F6vM7z\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images The former home of Sisters of the Most Holy and Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary is located in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles.\\nBut since 2015, the nuns have been involved in a heated dispute with the Archdiocese of Los Angeles over who has the right to sell the property. The archdiocese struck a deal with Perry to sell the 8-acre property for $14.5 million. Perry has reportedly said she wants to live on the property with her mother and grandmother.\\nThe Los Angeles Archdiocese claims the property was no longer suitable for the elderly women. The nuns moved out of the convent in 2011.\\n“There are a lot of stairs, and it’s a really big space as well,” Adrian Alarcon, a senior spokesperson for the archdiocese, told The Daily Beast. “A lot of the sisters now live in assisted living homes or retirement homes where they can get the proper care they need.”\\nCallanan and fellow sister Catherine Rose Holzman attempted to sell the property to a local restaurateur, Dana Hollister, for $15.5 million, according to the Los Angeles Times. Hollister reportedly wanted to turn the property into a hotel.\\nA Los Angeles County superior court judge ruled that the nuns’ sale was invalid in March 2017.\\nCanon law dictates that the sale of any property for more than $7.5 million requires the Vatican’s approval. The judge found that nuns did not receive permission from the pope, the Holy See or their local archbishop for the sale, the Los Angeles Times reports.\\nIn November, a jury decided that Hollister had intentionally interfered with the sale. The jury awarded the archdiocese $3.47 million in lawyer’s fees, while Perry’s company, Bird Nest LLC, was awarded $1.57 million in fees.\\n“I am thrilled with the outcome,” Perry’s manager, Steve Jensen, told the Los Angeles Times in November. “It just proves that we have been right all the way along.”\\nPatrick T.

She was 89 years old.\\nHolzman spoke to Los Angeles station KTTV about the fight with Perry hours before her death. It would end up being her final interview.\\n“To Katy Perry, please stop. It’s not doing anyone any good except hurting a lot of people,” Holzman told the station.\\nCallanan started a GoFundMe page in October 2017 to help raise money for the legal fight.

Her anti-war statement, like so many that came after it, did not come without sacrifice. She was court martialled and sentenced to six months hard labour – though in the end never served her sentence.\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Susan Schnall in Vietnam. Photograph: Nina Schnall\\nSchnall is just one of the dozen of veterans who are visiting Vietnam for the opening of an exhibition that honours the almost-forgotten yet pivotal role that active duty servicemen men and women played in the anti-war movement.\\nSchnall is one of many who feature in the exhibition, held at the War Remnants museum in Vietnam’s capital Ho Chi Minh City. A picture of her leading the GI anti-war march days before she was court martialled will hang in pride of place, alongside newsletters, posters and handwritten letters and photographs, most of which have never been exhibited.\\nWhile the stereotypical image of the Vietnam anti-war protester is hippies on campus, flowers in hand, by 1968 every major demonstration was actually led by active-duty officers. Most had returned so horrified by what they had seen and done, they became the most vocal and forceful voices in the anti-war movement.\\nThe exhibition, titled Waging Peace, opens in the midst of the 50th anniversary of the Tet Offensive – a brutal turning point in the war – and will travel to Notre Dame University in the US after Vietnam.\\nWaging Peace has been curated by Ron Carver, who worked alongside active GIs and servicemen in the anti-war movement from 1968.\\nFor Carver and the GIs involved, telling this story in Vietnam was essential and at the exhibition opening on 19 March the US veterans will meet with their Vietnamese counterparts.\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Vietnam veterans demonstrate against the war outside the US Capitol on 23 April 1971. Photograph: Fred W. McDarrah/Getty Images\\nPatriotic duty, then a sense of betrayal\\nCarver helped in the network of coffeehouses, the beating heart of the anti war-movement, which were casual gathering spaces set up near army bases in the US (an estimated 300 existed across the US). Here, disaffected servicemen and army personnel would share stories of how they had become convinced the invasion was, as Carver described it, “a cruel, terrible thing,”\\n“A lot of these soldiers felt very angry,” said Carver. “Many of them had volunteered to go into the military thinking it was a patriotic and righteous thing to do, and when they went over there and saw the Vietnamese population did not want us, saw the brutality and the war crimes that our country was committing, they felt very betrayed and were highly, highly motivated to develop resistance.”\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Inside the Fort Dix Coffee House in Wrightstown, New Jersey, before it was bombed and closed. Photograph: Supplied\\nIt was not just conversation that came out of these coffeehouses. They were the hubs of the underground newspapers that proliferated during the war, filled with firsthand accounts from GIs of brutality from the frontline and telling a truth the government and the military tried to suppress. It was often a DIY operation by the GIs who would put the newspapers together by hand and then photocopy them.\\nThey form a focal part of the exhibition. It is thought there were more than 5,000 underground newspapers at the height of the anti-war movement. In San Francisco, The Ally newspaper, which came out monthly, printed up to 20,000 copies each time, and they shipped batches of 100 to the soldiers in Vietnam, where they were a core part of the discord that erupted across military bases.\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A newsletter supporting the Fort Hood Three, who in 1966 refused to follow orders and go to Vietnam.\\nThe military fought back against the coffeehouses as best it could, using police to shut down them down and punishing GIs if they were found in possession of newspapers. They were even investigated by the FBI and, in Fort Dix, the coffeehouse was bombed by vigilantes.\\nYet the army came down heaviest on those whose anti-war statements were made in public defiance of orders. Among those honoured by the exhibition are the “Fort Hood Three”, a trio of soldiers who were drafted and trained but refused to report for duty in 1966. It landed them with a court martial and a three-year jail sentence, but as newspapers and posters in the exhibition reveal, they were also made into martyrs by the GI anti-war movement.\\n“ I really began to identify with the struggle of the Vietnamese people and I began to admire them,” said JJ Johnson, one of the Fort Hood 3. “And the strength to resist grew from the knowledge. I realised, ‘to hell with them, I can’t take part in this.’ And we wanted to say it publicly so people knew this was a feeling that exists within the military.”\\nThe exhibition acknowledges that not all the sacrifices were purely public. Chuck Searcy, who worked with Carver on the exhibition, spent a year in military intelligence in Saigon in 1968 and came back vehemently against the war. He began to speak out, but was subsequently disowned by his father, a former World War Two veteran, and estranged from his family for two years.\\n“My parents were dismayed,” he said. “It was embarrassing to them. I remember my father said ‘you’re not a good American, you’re not a patriot any more.’ He said to me, ‘what happened to you over there, did they turn you into a communist?’ So many families went through that.”\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chuck Searcy today outside the land mine action centre in Vietnam. Photograph: Ron Carver\\nSchnall, Johnson and Searcy all agreed that despite the multitudes of books and documentaries on Vietnam, the role that GIs played in fighting for peace from within has always been downplayed and overlooked.\\n“People need to know that active duty soldiers at the height of the Vietnam war, in the belly of the beast, the belly of the green machine, were able to build a movement that ended up crippling the ground forces and stopped them being effective,” added Carver. “That should be an inspiration to people, and that’s what it’s all about.”\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

(Photo: STR, AFP/Getty Images)\\n• Pulled out of international trade agreements\\nOn his first official workday in office last year on Jan. 23, Trump pulled the U.S. out of a major trade pact negotiated by President Barack Obama with 11countries that border the Pacific Ocean, calling his move \"a great thing for the American worker.\" The other nations vowed to push ahead on the agreement without the U.S.\\nThe same day, the White House said Trump would renegotiate the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada to stop U.S. companies from moving plants to its neighbors — particularly Mexico — and eliminating American jobs. If a new accord could not be reached that is fairer to American workers and reduces the U.S. trade deficit, Trump said he would withdraw from the deal. The U.S. neighbors have resisted major changes, and the talks continue.\\nBoth gestures were disastrous for U.S. trade and influence, said Anders Aslund, an economist at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, which promotes trans-Atlantic relations.\\nHe said the U.S. marginalized itself from Mexico, a key partner in both trade deals. \"It also means the U.S. isolates itself from Latin America,\" Aslund added.\\nThe agreement with Pacific countries was supposed to set standards for trade, labor and the environment for East Asia under U.S. leadership. By pulling out, Trump in effect allows China to set those standards, Aslund said.\\nTrump pledged to negotiate better agreements with each country involved, but \"there are no bilateral trade deals being discussed with the United States,\" Aslund said.\\nMore: Trump makes it official: He will renegotiate NAFTA\\nProtesters sit together in an intersection in the streets of Miami, Fla., as they protest the Trump administration\\'s immigration policies on Jan. 17, 2018.

Federal courts blocked the ban, the list of countries changed, and the Supreme Court approved the latest version, which affects Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Chad, while legal challenges continue.\\nThe ban has been decried by other countries around the world.\\nHe also promised to build a wall along the southern U.S. border to keep out illegal immigrants and said Mexico would pay for it. Trump\\'s chief of staff, John Kelly, told Democratic lawmakers this week that Mexico will not pay for the wall, though Trump continues to insist it will.\\nThe Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it. Parts will be, of necessity, see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains, wastelands or tough rivers or water..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2018\\n....The Wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. The $20 billion dollar Wall is “peanuts” compared to what Mexico makes from the U.S. NAFTA is a bad joke! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2018\\nThe immigration issue blew up again last week when reports surfaced that Trump referred to Haiti and countries in Africa as \"shithole countries\" during a meeting with lawmakers in the Oval Office. At least five African countries and the African Union made formal diplomatic protests.\\nThe president\\'s gaffs could make it difficult for some countries to cooperate with the U.S. on such priorities as counterterrorism, said Daniel Fried, a former assistant secretary of State. \"It may not have an effect immediately or today or tomorrow, but it’s going to accumulate,\" he said.\\nMore: Supreme Court allows Trump travel ban to take full effect\\nA protester holds a banner during a demonstration in the center of Brussels on Wednesday, May 24, 2017.

In June, Trump affirmed the U.S. commitment to aid any of the 28 NATO nations if attacked. He did so after other NATO leaders said they were prepared to maintain a collective self-defense even without American support.\\nBut the damage was done, Aslund said: \"Even when Trump eventually came out in favor of Article 5 he does not look like a reliable ally.\"\\nDespite that, Aslund said, Trump did more than the Obama administration to counter Russia\\'s threat to NATO\\'s eastern flank.\\nTrump reluctantly signed legislation last summer giving Congress sole authority over lifting the sanctions on Russia for its support of separatists in eastern Ukraine. Trump put troops in the Baltics to counter the Russian threat. And he agreed for the first time on Dec. 22 to sell lethal weapons to Ukraine.\\nFlood water inundated the German village of Rees on the Rhine River, Jan. 8, 2018.

Trump, who has disputed a scientific consensus that human activity is causing higher temperatures, said he would be willing to renegotiate a deal \"that\\'s more fair\" to the United States. Trump\\'s actions, making the U.S. the lone holdout from the global accord, drew international condemnations from American allies in Europe, who ruled out new talks.\\nSince the Paris agreement was negotiated with Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Europe \"now has to deal with China on its own, and the U.S. has no influence,\" Aslund said.\\nMore: U.S. withdrawing from Paris climate agreement, Trump announces\\nA photo taken on Nov. 8, 2017, shows demonstrators holding a placard showing a picture of President Trump as they wait for his appearance outside the National Cemetery in Seoul. US President Donald Trump\\'s notoriously threatening rhetoric towards nuclear-armed North Korea may have helped bring about a new round of talks between North and South Korea, analysts have said. (Photo: JUNG YEON-JE, AFP/Getty Images)\\n• Threatened nuclear war with North Korea\\nTrump used incendiary threats about war with North Korea in August that departed from the more restrained language other presidents have used and sparked international fears of a catastrophic conflict. After North Korea said it would fire missiles in the direction of Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific, Trump responded that \"North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” North Korea never followed through on its threat. Trump also traded unprecedented personal insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump called Kim “little rocket man\" and “a sick puppy.” Kim called Trump \"a dotard,” meaning senile.\\nA file photo taken on Nov. 8, 2017 shows demonstrators shouting slogans during a rally outside the National Assembly where President Trump was speaking, in Seoul, South Korea.

(Photo: AP)\\n• Repudiated the Iran nuclear deal\\nTrump last week issued an ultimatum to European allies to fix \"disastrous flaws\" in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal or the U.S. will withdraw. His warning Friday came as he extended waivers of key economic sanctions on Iran, saying this would be the last extension.\\nThe move keeps the deal alive for several months, despite Trump\\'s past vows to scuttle the Iran agreement with the U.S. and five other world powers.\\nTrump wants Britain, France and Germany to agree to additional restraints on Iran\\'s ballistic missiles, inspections of suspected nuclear sites and permanent restrictions on Iran\\'s ability to secretly produce a nuclear bomb.\\nMore: Iran deal survives for now; Trump will waive sanctions\\nThe accord lifted international sanctions on Iran in return for limits on Iran’s nuclear program. Iran\\'s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif accused Trump of trying \"to undermine a solid multilateral agreement.\"\\nDanielle Pletka, a Middle East analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, said many analysts and lawmakers agree with Trump that the Iran deal is flawed. \"If he can leverage a better deal, that’s all for the good.\" Pletka said.\\nBut Miller said the risk is considerable. \"If Trump’s approach results in no deal — and we walk — is that a success? I would argue probably not,\" he said.\\n• Recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital\\nTrump’s formal recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in December angered Muslim nations and drew a rebuke at the United Nations from 128 countries. Only seven small nations joined the U.S. and Israel in voting against the U.N. resolution Dec. 21, while 35 nations abstained.\\nTrump said his decision should have no bearing on final borders to be negotiated as part of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.\\nOn Tuesday, the Trump administration withheld $65 million, more than half the amount due, from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which has supported Palestinian refugees since the 1948 Arab war that erupted when Israel was created. The Trump administration called for a \"fundamental re-examination\" of the agency.\\nPletka said tepid reaction in the Middle East to Trump\\'s decisions showed that support for Palestinians \"has dropped with Arab states that once supported them unreservedly.\"\\nMore: Trump declares Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, breaking with decades of U.S. foreign policy\\nMore: Trump\\'s \\'America First\\' national security strategy emphasizes economic competitiveness\\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2EVr3p1\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

This is a story we tell ourselves. There are places where no one bothers to differentiate between truth and lies; other places. Such as Russia, where there is the facade of a democratic election, but what matters is simply control of the narrative. We watch as various Russian diplomats deny any Russian connection to the poisoning of the Sergei Skripal and his daughter. We look at the US, where they have lost count of Donald Trump’s untruths. He lies as he breathes; the effect is numbing. He has told so many lies that the latest ones float by.\\nThis incessant lying wears the public down. Some Russians claim the lies that are told require a person to split into different realities, so each thing is true at the time. There is no objective truth, only versions of it. The manufacture of chaos is implicit in this deliberate destabilisation. We can locate lying within the pathology of individuals, but it requires ongoing turmoil to sustain it. Trump knows this.\\nYet this creation of pandemonium to disguise dishonesty is something we too are familiar with in the burble of Boris Johnson, foreign secretary. The evasions, the metaphors, the spluttering, the wit is, to use a Johnsonian word, a miasma – a fog to hide mendacity. Johnson is a man who has been elevated rather than held accountable for his lies. Some are big: the famed £350m a week after Brexit that we will get back. (Lying about Brussels made his name as a hack.) Some are small – if extramarital affairs and children can be described in this way. It is still astonishing to me that a man of so little credibility represents our country abroad – and especially now. Over the weekend he admitted, in a BBC interview, that he had played a tennis match in 2014 with Lubov Chernukhin, wife of Vladimir Putin’s former deputy finance minister, in return for a £160,000 donation to the Conservative party. It was a matter for the authorities not him, Johnson said, “if there is evidence of gross corruption in the way [Chernukhin] obtained his wealth”. The Tory party is relaxed about donations from oligarchs and it is obvious that Johnson is more relaxed than most, although he seemed somewhat tense defending this. Perhaps because it surely makes his position asking for a unified stance on Russia more difficult.\\nHypocrisy, though, is the least of it. Johnson just doesn’t “do” accountability. Why should he, when he simply gets promoted out of culpability?\\nThis month he was questioned about possible misconduct in public office because £46m has been spent on something that did not happen: the garden bridge. How was such a huge sum of money spent? How in 2016 was funding for construction released even though the original conditions for that money had not been met? Johnson as mayor watered down these conditions. Labour and the Lib Dems are rightly asking questions about this. Johnson said the explanation “is something which, I’m afraid, I simply don’t have, at this distance in time”. In what world is this good enough? Lawyers say a charge of public misconduct could follow if Johnson’s actions showed “reckless indifference”. A causal observer may say that this is surely Johnson’s modus operandi.\\nHow is it that someone in power can lie and cheat, we may wonder. How is fake news spread? How is disinformation used? Lying becomes simply an exercise of power. Consequences are for small people. Politics becomes simply a scripted reality show with characters. This is said of Russia, but watching Johnson, maybe these things are not so foreign to us after all.\\nIs it time to admit privacy is finished?\\nIn another life, I would not use social media. I would write long and thoughtful letters and attend polite debates. I would not get moth killer delivered by Amazon. I would never take an Uber. I would live up a tree.\\nIn this brave not particularly new world, though, all these things are linked, and I am linked through them. I may extricate myself from Facebook following the new revelations, but part of me thinks it is all too late. While, politically, of course I don’t want the engineering of elections based on the exchange of Facebook profiles, I can’t say that this feeling of being watched is novel. Or as individual that I know how to react. Once supermarkets introduced reward cards in the mid-90s, I was aware that my purchases were being tracked, but I shrugged my shoulders. It became ever more noticeable with social media that what was being advertised to me were things I had already bought. There is still this peculiar glitch in the algorithm whereby if you buy one toaster it is presumed you want another. You don’t.\\nThe cluminess of such ads acted as a reassurance. Lately, though, there is the listening by phones, and this does feel like an invasion of privacy. Many people do still want to share pictures of their cat and baby, but there is somehow a dull acceptance that the idea of privacy is now as revolutionary and far off as the world wide web once was. Only disconnect.\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jeremy Corbyn with a photoshopped hat on his head. Photograph: Finnbarr Webster Editorial / Ala/Alamy Stock Photo\\nSpare me the Corbynista gnashing of teeth\\nThe cat in the hat furore – over whether the BBC photoshopped Jeremy Corbyn’s “Lenin cap” to look more “red” in front of a Kremlin backdrop on Newsnight – is one rum do. The suggestion is that the BBC made Corbyn look like a Russian stooge and that it is never fair in its coverage of him. There may be something to this, but the gnashing of teeth from his followers did not do anything but make them look cultish and obsessive as two people lay critically ill in hospital. The idea that, until we saw him in that hat, we had no idea of his geopolitical persuasions is as strange as the idea that we have never before seen any imagery that attached him to communist propaganda.

Newslook\\nCuba is expected to name a new president April 19, 2018, which would mark the first time a Castro is not head of state in nearly 60 years. In this 2011 file photo, former president Fidel Castro, left, and his brother, President Raúl Castro, attend the 6th Congress of the Cuban Communist Party in Havana. (Photo: Javier Galeano, AP)\\nIf all goes as expected, Cuba will name a new president in two weeks — the first time in nearly 60 years that the communist country\\'s leader won\\'t be a Castro.\\nOutgoing President Raúl Castro will still loom large in retirement, much like his older brother Fidel Castro, who hovered over the nation\\'s affairs in the years leading up to his death in 2016. But when the Cuban National Assembly meets April 19 to name the new president, it will mark a major shift in the history of the Caribbean island that has antagonized and tantalized Americans for decades.\\n\"This is not a transition to democracy, but this is enormous,\" said Pedro Freyre, an attorney with the Akerman law firm who represents several American companies doing business in Cuba. \"As our president would say, \\'It\\'s huge.\\' \"\\nCastro\\'s successor likely will be a man largely unknown outside Cuba: Miguel Díaz-Canel, 57, who has risen steadily through the ranks of the Communist Party of Cuba. His selection would represent a symbolic change for a regime mostly led by the bearded guerrillas who fought alongside the Castros during the 1959 revolution that overthrew the government of Fulgencio Batista.\\nDíaz-Canel\\'s ascension to the presidency is not a guarantee. Would-be successors have come and gone over the years. And there is always the possibility Castro chooses someone from the same generation as the Castro brothers and fellow revolutionary Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara.\\nIt also has become more difficult to assess the political situation in Cuba after the U.S. pulled most of its diplomats off the island. President Trump ordered a sharp drawdown at the U.S. Embassy in Havana after a series of mysterious \"health attacks\" against employees there.\\nStill, Cuba experts agree Castro probably will stand by Díaz-Canel.\\nCastro and his revolutionary cohorts could be making a pragmatic decision to anoint a younger leader at least to give the appearance the regime is changing with the times, said Frank Mora, director of the Kimberly Green Latin American and Caribbean Center at Florida International University.\\n\"They\\'re all in their late 80s,\" he said. \"They understand that they have to hand power over to someone who will live longer than a couple of years.\"\\nCuban First Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel attends the opening of the Havana International Book Fair on Feb. 1, 2018. Diaz-Canel is expected to be named president of Cuba in April after President Raul Castro steps down. (Photo: Adalberto Roque, AFP/Getty Images)\\nExperts disagree over how much power Díaz-Canel will truly hold and wonder whether Castro continues to run the show as head of the Communist Party of Cuba.\\nMora said Cuba won\\'t be entirely out of Castro\\'s grip until he\\'s dead. \"He\\'s still going to be there in the background, still wearing his four-star military uniform,\" he said.\\nThat role would suit Raúl, since he was always more comfortable operating in anonymity, unlike Fidel who basked in the spotlight, said Jaime Suchlicki, director of the Cuban Studies Institute in Miami.\\n\"Raúl never liked the diplomatic activities, going to the parties,\" Suchlicki said. \"So he\\'s going to put this guy in there and create a facade for the new generation. But Díaz-Canel is not going to have any decision-making power.\"\\nIt\\'s possible Castro is ready to hand over the reins and ease into retirement after nearly six decades of helping keep the government intact. He has talked about spending more time in his native Santiago, on the eastern end of the island and isolated from the diplomatic and economic hub of Havana.\\nFreyre said Castro probably will take a more diminished role, emerging only if the new crop of leaders stray too far from the script or bicker too much among themselves.\\n\"Think of it as a telenovela,\" Freyre said. \"The (father) is about to go. The kids are throwing their weight around, saying \\'Papa wanted me to have the hacienda\\' and another saying \\'He wanted me to have the Rolls Royce.\\'\\n\"Raúl is tired. He\\'s not going to run the show day to day. But if the elbow-throwing gets out of hand, the old guy comes in and says, \\'Enough!\\' \"\\nAnother question facing Díaz-Canel is whether he will be able to control the government ministries filled with Castro supporters.\\nThat includes Cuba\\'s military, officials who manage Cuba\\'s centrally planned economy and legions of provincial leaders who have run things a certain way for decades.\\n\"For being a \\'revolutionary government,\\' they are incredibly conservative,\" Freyre said. \"They\\'re very cautious; they\\'re very careful. This is a government that never rushes into doing anything.\"\\nDíaz-Canel seems fine with that. Experts describe him as a true believer in the Marxist-Leninist ideology that formed the basis of Fidel Castro\\'s government. He supported the marginal changes implemented during the 12 years of Raúl Castro\\'s rule, such as allowing Cubans to buy and sell property for the first time, work privately outside the state-run economy and get slightly expanded access to computers, cellphones and the Internet.\\nHe also has clearly adopted the anti-imperialistic stance of his predecessors. In a speech in October, he blasted the United States for its insistence that Cuba move toward a more democratic government.\\n\"Imperialism can never be trusted, not even a tiny bit, never,” Díaz-Canel said, echoing the words of Guevara on the 50th anniversary of his death.\\nIn the end, the biggest hurdle facing Díaz-Canel could be his ability to win over the public.\\nFidel and Raúl Castro could always point to their successful revolution as their claim to power. One can\\'t travel far in Cuba without finding a black-and-white photo of the brothers clawing through the mountains of eastern Cuba and fighting their way toward Havana.\\nDiaz-Canel \"doesn\\'t have those bona fides. He doesn\\'t have that credibility that the first generation of barbudos had,\" Mora said. \"His basis of legitimacy can\\'t be 1959. It has to be, \\'What have you done for me lately?\\' \"\\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2GAS7zj\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Franklin/AP\\nUpdated at 5:27 p.m. ET\\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that immigrants, even those with permanent legal status and asylum seekers, do not have the right to periodic bond hearings.\\nIt\\'s a profound loss for those immigrants appealing what are sometimes indefinite detentions by the government. Many are held for long periods of time — on average, 13 months — after being picked up for things as minor as joyriding. Some are held even longer.\\nThe case, Jennings v. Rodriguez, has implications for legal permanent residents whom the government wants to deport because they committed crimes and for asylum seekers who are awaiting a court date after turning themselves in at the border. Immigrant advocates contend that many of these immigrants have a right to be free on bail until their case is heard.\\nBut the court wrote in its 5-3 opinion Tuesday, \"Immigration officials are authorized to detain certain aliens in the course of immigration proceedings while they determine whether those aliens may be lawfully present in the country.\"\\nThe majority opinion was penned by Justice Samuel Alito and joined by the court\\'s conservatives. (Justice Elena Kagan did not participate. She recused herself, stemming from work she had done as former President Barack Obama\\'s solicitor general.)\\nThe decision reversed a Ninth Circuit ruling, but this is not the last word and could come back to the high court.\\nThe Supreme Court sent the case the back to the lower court with two questions unresolved. First, whether indefinite detention without a chance for bail is unconstitutional. Second, whether the challenge to that no-bail provision can be brought as a class action, instead of as individual cases.\\nStanford Law professor Lucas Guttentag says that in practical terms, the class action question is enormously important because most of the immigrants affected by Tuesday\\'s decision don\\'t have lawyers.\\n\"If they\\'re required to proceed individually, many of them will never be able to pursue their claims,\" he says. \"A class action provides protection to everyone, not just to those who have a lawyer who can file a lawsuit.\"\\nNo one can claim, nor since the time of slavery has anyone to my knowledge successfully claimed, that persons held within the United States are totally without constitutional protection.\\nOn Tuesday, Justice Stephen G. Breyer read from his dissent, a rare move for the court and an indication of just how passionately he disagrees with the majority opinion.\\n\"We need only recall the words of the Declaration of Independence,\" Breyer said, \"in particular its insistence that all men and women have \\'certain unalienable Rights,\\' and that among them is the right to \\'Liberty.\\' \"\\nHe continued, calling the ruling \"legal fiction.\"\\n\"Whatever the fiction, would the Constitution leave the Government free to starve, beat, or lash those held within our boundaries?\" Breyer argued. \"If not, then, whatever the fiction, how can the Constitution authorize the Government to imprison arbitrarily those who, whatever we might pretend, are in reality right here in the United States?\"\\nBreyer added, \"No one can claim, nor since the time of slavery has anyone to my knowledge successfully claimed, that persons held within the United States are totally without constitutional protection.\"\\nThe lead plaintiff in the case is a legal permanent resident, Alejandro Rodriguez, who came to the U.S. as a child and worked as a dental assistant. As a teenager, he was convicted for joyriding, and at 24, he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance.\\nRodriguez was detained for three years without the right to appear before a judge to ask for bond.\\nThe American Civil Liberties Union took up Rodriguez\\'s case. The civil rights group filed a class action lawsuit and eventually won his release and the cancellation of his deportation order. Rodriguez remains in the United States.\\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the immigrant detainees and asylum seekers can\\'t be detained indefinitely and that they have a right to a bond hearing every six months. The appellate court also held that in order to hold these detainees, the government must show that the immigrants would pose a danger or become a flight risk if set free.\\nThe Obama administration appealed to the high court, insisting that Congress — not the courts — has the power to make immigration law and that the law allows the government to detain \"criminal and terrorist aliens\" as well as \"aliens seeking admission to the United States.\"\\nThe Trump administration continued the case.\\nThe administration also argued that detained immigrants should not be recognized as a class that could bring legal action. Lawyers for the Justice Department said detainees should rely on individual habeas corpus petitions to challenge their detentions.\\nThe ACLU countered that few detainees have access to legal counsel and that a backlog of such habeas corpus petitions almost guarantees delays in winning release.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

I apologized and pledged that I would learn from my mistake,” John Parker said in a letter to local, state and national officials that tendered his resignation as the Duval County Democratic state committeeman and as a DNC member from Florida.\\nStory Continued Below\\n“I understand my error perpetuates divisiveness and does not allow us an opportunity for the important types of meaningful discourse — a conversation our party must engage in sooner rather than later — that help us grow as individuals and a party protecting the dignity of all people,” he wrote.\\nParker had said he meant to say “people of color” instead of “colored people” and eventually apologized for his offhanded remarks Jan. 22 after a local Democratic Party meeting in Jacksonville, Fla.\\n“I am confident that a full investigation would have shown that I erred with my mouth, not my heart,” Parker wrote, explaining he was resigning for the good of the party.\\nParker denied other accusations that he used more racially charged language. As he resisted calls to step down, some felt their complaints were being ignored in the ensuing months.\\nThat led to increased media scrutiny and the remarkable call by Parker’s wife, Duval County Democratic Executive Committee Chairwoman Lisa King, to say Monday that he should quit. After POLITICO published a story Wednesday on the controversy, Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo broke months of silence and said he needed to go.\\n“Along with DEC Chair Lisa King, I also asked John Parker to resign. I believe him stepping down is the right thing to do,” Rizzo said in a statement to POLITICO.\\nThough some Democrats felt the new chairwoman had done enough, insiders say she had held private conversations with surrogates to try to get Parker to leave his position. But he stayed on, troubling party officials who worried about the increasing racial tensions in Duval County, a key Florida battleground where the party is counting on strong black turnout in November if Gov. Rick Scott challenges Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and if Democrats are to win the governor’s mansion for the first time in 20 years.\\nOn Wednesday morning, Democratic gubernatorial candidate and former Rep. Gwen Graham called Parker — who had endorsed her — and asked him to quit and then publicly called on him to resign.\\n\"I am very concerned about this situation,” Graham said. “We need to bring Democrats together in 2018, not create distractions and divisions through our words and actions. I urge Mr. Parker to apologize fully and resign his positions as Duval County Democratic State Committeeman and on the Democratic National Committee.\"\\nTallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, the only African American gubernatorial candidate, joined with Graham in calling on Parker to quit as did one of Parker’s top African-American allies, state Sen. Audrey Gibson of Jacksonville.\\n“While I do not believe John had any intent of malice in the manner in which he spoke, it is imperative that for the good of this city and the local and statewide party that he take this action,” Gibson said in a written statement Wednesday.\\nBut another top Democratic official from the county, state Rep. Kimberly Daniels (D-Jacksonville), expressed more outrage and was the first elected official to call on him to quit. She also said Parker’s wife should step down as well because she showed “complicity” in not calling on him to resign until media pressure mounted.\\nBut as he stalled, Democrats began breaking their silence.\\nDaniels also leveled other more serious charges about Parker’s alleged use of racial language, including “disgraceful comments about integration.”\\n“Preceding this instance, he allegedly referred to the Working People Caucus as the ‘Poor Black People Working Caucus\\' and called a constituent the \\'mayor’s mammy,\\'\" Daniels wrote in a press statement Monday night. “Unlike, other leaders in Florida, even after a request from the Florida Black Caucus, Mr. Parker has not resigned.”\\nWhen Parker finally quit, he acknowledged his errors.\\n“I take responsibility for my mistake and as such is the impetus of my decision,” he said. “I resign for the good of my Party and all those who are fighting so hard for a better world than the one we are in now.”\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

But the subsequent tour for the book \"What Happened\" has helped keep the former U.S. secretary of state visible despite her devastating loss to Donald Trump.\\nOn Monday, Clinton activated her political machine, attending a gathering of nearly a dozen progressive groups supported by Onward Together, the post-election political organization she founded that\\'s aimed at “advancing the progressive vision that earned nearly 66 million votes in the last election.”\\n\"So I feel as strongly today as I ever have that we all have to stand up and defend our country, and most importantly, our democracy.” - Hillary Clinton\\n“I don’t want to see us go backwards,” Clinton told Bustle. “But organized interests fueled by ideology and huge amounts of money are trying to take us backwards. So I feel as strongly today as I ever have that we all have to stand up and defend our country, and most importantly, our democracy.”\\nThe Clinton family also plans to restart fundraising efforts for the Clinton Foundation, which is being investigated for “pay to play” politics while Clinton headed the State Department (2009-13), inviting people to a benefit event on May 24 in New York, according to Axios. The price for attending ranges from $2,500 for a cocktail party and dinner – up to $100,000 for a special reception.\\nHer return to political life comes ahead of midterm elections this November, where energized Democratic voters hope to take back some control in Washington, D.C., following nearly two years of the contentious Trump presidency.\\n“Just as I’m working here today to try to make sure we’re prepared to do everything we can in November, there are thousands of people on the other side who are doing the same,” Clinton told Bustle. “Even though I think the energy is on our side, we have to translate that into a very strong electoral strategy.”\\nClinton’s political organization boasts of giving over $1 million in grants in its first year to left-wing groups.

So this is where we wanted to take a step back and look at what it all means. We'll start with NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thank you so much for joining us once again.\\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Happy to be here.\\nMARTIN: So what have we heard so far from President Trump since the shutdown started?\\nLIASSON: What we've heard from President Trump is a pretty simple message - and he said it over and over again on Twitter - Democrats are holding the military hostage over their desire for unchecked illegal immigration. And that's a message that I think his base will find very appealing, whether it helps him with anyone beyond his base is not clear.\\nMARTIN: And what about the Democrats and what about that argument? I mean, the polls show - and there's been some recent polling on this - it shows that the whole idea of protecting DACA recipients is politically popular but not when you've posed it as a tradeoff between...\\nLIASSON: Right.\\nMARTIN: ...You know, keeping the government open and helping them. So what about on the Democratic side?\\nLIASSON: The problem for both sides is that neither is convinced that the other guy will pay politically. For Democrats, they know, as you said, that something like 90 percent of Americans are sympathetic with their position on the DREAMers but not shutting down the government over the DREAMers. And when people are polled about who would you blame. It turns out that majorities, overall, would blame Republicans for a shutdown. After all, they control all branches of government.\\nBut in those big five states, the red states where Democratic Senate incumbents are running for re-election - and that's what Democrats are most worried about in those states - Missouri, Montana, West Virginia, Indiana, South Dakota - that's where Democrats would be blamed if it looks like they're doing this because of the DREAMers.\\nAnd in terms of whether the president would be blamed, we do know that the hashtag @Trumpshutdown, not @Schumershutdown, but @Trumpshutdown was the top trending topic on Twitter on Friday night. So a lot of people voted for him thinking he was a businessman who would come to Washington, make deals, which is what he promised, make the government work. And now here we are on the first anniversary of his inauguration with a shutdown.\\nMARTIN: Just building on that point, though, you know, in the past, the polls have suggested that Republicans were blamed for the shutdown but then they went on to midterm elections and actually did fine - in fact, did very, very well, according to the historical pattern that says, you know, the party in the White House tends to suffer in midterms, right? So any sense of what's going to happen this year?\\nLIASSON: Well, this is the first shutdown that we've ever had under one-party control of government. The last shutdown in 2013, of course, there was a Democrat in the White House, Republicans in Congress. And what you're talking about is absolutely true. What happened was Republicans initially were blamed for the shutdown.\\nThe approval ratings for the Republican Party dropped faster and deeper than they had ever dropped before during that shutdown. But then what people forget about is that then the Obamacare website debuted and crashed. And it totally wiped that story of the shutdown off the front pages. And that's what could happen now if we have a very short shutdown. If something happens to wipe this story in our kind of ADD news environment, we might be talking about something completely different a week from now.\\nMARTIN: Mara, just one more minute on this, if I could, before we head into the Barbershop because I'm going to ask them to reflect on this question. You know, here we are on the one-year anniversary of President Trump's inauguration. What more do we know about him now than we did a year ago?\\nLIASSON: Wow. Well, I think what we've - what I wondered about when he was inaugurated was, would he be different in degree or kind? Was he just a ruder, cruder kind of conservative Republican or something completely different? I think in terms of domestic policy, he's become a pretty standard conservative Republican - tax cuts, Neil Gorsuch, deregulation.\\nBut I think for - on the other hand, his divisive behavior and his continuing attacks on democratic institutions like the independent judiciary, free press, the FBI - I think that shows us that he conceives of the presidency in a completely different way than any of his predecessors. He doesn't see himself as the moral leader of the country or with the responsibility to unify the country. He has a totally different concept of the presidency.\\nMARTIN: That's NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thank you.\\nLIASSON: Thank you.\\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

He told investigators that he set up a meeting in the Seychelles between Prince and Russian sovereign wealth fund CEO Kirill Dmitriev, mere days before Trump was inaugurated, sources familiar with the investigation said this week.\\nNader has submitted to three interviews with special counsel investigators and four appearances before a federal grand jury in Washington since agents stopped him at Dulles International Airport in January, served him with a grand jury subpoena and seized his electronic devices, including his cell phone. Documents obtained by Mueller suggest that before and after Prince met Nader in New York a week before the trip to the Seychelles, Nader shared information with Prince about Dmitriev, sources familiar with the investigation told ABC News, which appears to be inconsistent with Prince’s sworn testimony before a U.S. House of Representatives investigative panel.\\n\"I didn\\'t fly there to meet any Russian guy,\" Prince told the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in November. He testified that he travelled to the Seychelles for a meeting with United Arab Emirates officials about possible business opportunities, and they introduced him – unexpectedly – to Dmitriev.\\nAs of late March, Mueller’s team has not asked Prince – whose sister Betsy DeVos serves as Trump’s Secretary of Education – to appear before the grand jury being used to investigate whether Trump campaign officials or transition aides colluded with Russian government operatives, according to one of Prince’s friends.\\nJason Alden/Bloomberg via Getty Images, FILE\\nPrince told the House Intelligence Committee that his meeting with Dmitriev was a chance encounter “down in the bar” at the suggestion of \"one of the brothers\" of the United Arab Emirates\\' leader Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed al-Nayhan.\\n\"At the end, one of the entourage says, \\'Hey, by the way, there’s this Russian guy that we’ve dealt with in the past. He’s here also to see someone from the Emirati delegation. And you should meet him. He\\'d be an interesting guy for you to know, since you’re doing a lot in the oil and gas and mineral space,’” Prince told lawmakers under oath in his sworn testimony. “So, as I recall, I met him, this same guy I talked about, Kirill Dmitriev. Met him down in the bar after dinner, and we talked for 30 minutes over a beer, and that was it.”\\nSources say Nader -- who worked at the time for the Emirati leader, known as \"MBZ” – tells a different story. According to multiple sources, the U.A.E., an important U.S. ally increasingly eager to be seen as a global powerbroker, wanted to bring a Russian close to the Kremlin together with someone Nader believed was a trusted confidant of members of the incoming administration.\\nSources tell ABC News Nader met with Prince at New York\\'s Pierre Hotel a week before the Jan. 11, 2017 meeting in the Seychelles, and later sent Prince biographical information about Dmitriev, which, according to those sources, noted that Dmitriev had been appointed by Putin to oversee the state-run sovereign wealth fund.\\nNader says he then facilitated and personally attended the meetings, including one between Prince and Dmitriev, at a resort owned by MBZ off the coast of East Africa, the sources told ABC News. One of the primary goals of the meeting, Nader told investigators, was to discuss foreign policy and to establish a line of communication between the Russian government and the incoming Trump administration, sources told ABC News.\\nNader — who Prince said in a 2010 lawsuit deposition had once represented his military contractor business in Iraq — was not mentioned in Prince\\'s congressional testimony despite Prince being asked by lawmakers who was present. Prince said only that Dmitriev\\'s wife was there but she left after a few minutes while they discussed terrorism and oil prices.\\nA spokesperson for Prince told ABC News on Thursday that \"Erik has said all there is to say to the committee and has nothing further to add.\" Prince has said that the Seychelles meeting was leaked to the news media last year in an illegal “unmasking” of his identity in U.S. signals intelligence intercepts.\\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\\nNader, a naturalized U.S. citizen, is an enigma in the nearly yearlong probe of the Trump presidential campaign\\'s dealings with Russians linked to the Kremlin.\\nHis background and credibility have come under attack as his name appeared in recent headlines. He has been arrested twice in the U.S., first in 1984 and again 1991, and convicted once, according to court records unsealed in March, for possession of pornographic videos featuring underage boys. He also reportedly served prison time in the Czech Republic in 2003 for similar crimes.\\nNader\\'s lawyers at powerhouse firm Latham & Watkins, which includes former Obama White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, have said unnamed individuals are dredging up the old criminal cases to discredit him as an important witness for Mueller. They declined to comment to ABC News on Nader\\'s interactions with the special counsel and Nader himself has refused to speak about the Russia probe.\\nFew in Washington remember George Nader, whose colorful biography reads like a spy thriller: his career has spanned the globe, and along the way he has been a hostage negotiator, arms broker, security operative and, now, an important witness for the former director of the FBI.\\nHe’s even negotiated with the Kremlin. According to Al-Monitor, a news website covering the Middle East, Nader helped broker a $4.2 billion arms deal between Iraq and Russia in 2012.\\nNader’s associates say he has embarked on countless sensitive diplomatic missions overseas and was once a special adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney. He had easy access to the White House under Presidents Reagan, both Bushes and Clinton, according to former officials, and he visited the Trump White House last year despite his criminal record.\\nNader posed with Trump for a picture and even helped arrange the new American president\\'s first major foreign trip to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia last year, two top Trump advisers told ABC News.\\n\"He has worked for the Israelis, the Syrians, the Iranians, the Saudis, the Emiratis, the Shiites in southern Iraq,\" said Mouafac Harb, a Lebanese former journalist who has known Nader for decades. \"He’s typical of the kind of shady operatives you often see in the Middle East.”\\nRon Sachs/AP Images, FILE\\nHis 1991 federal conviction in Alexandria, Virginia, for being caught returning from Germany with videotapes in his luggage \"depicting minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct\" highlights the conflicting chapters in his life.\\nProminent foreign policy figures sent testimonials to the federal trial court judge in Virginia, including one friend who said Nader, a Lebanese Christian, \"is risking his life\" to help free a dozen American, British and other hostages held in Beirut in 1991, by leveraging his close ties to the Shi\\'a terrorist group Hezbollah. The letters to the judge were provided to ABC News last week by Nader\\'s legal team.\\nThe judge in 1991 sentenced Nader to six months in a halfway house -- well below mandatory sentencing guidelines at that time -- and allowed him to travel to both Moscow and Beirut during his criminal proceedings, later citing Nader\\'s \"extraordinary cooperation with the government in certain areas.\"\\nThe 1991 criminal case was ordered sealed for six months. Instead, it remained under seal for 26 years, until a judge opened the case file last month amid news reports about Nader cooperating with Mueller. Sources told ABC News the U.S. government did not want Nader\\'s secrets easily unearthed while he operated as a backchannel on sensitive matters.\\n\"We used him because we needed all the channels we could get into the Syrian security establishment,\" said a former top career American diplomat in Damascus, who was aware of Nader\\'s activities in the years following his 1991 conviction. \"Nobody was looking for his child porn case. Nobody cared about that stuff at all back then. He was providing too invaluable a service to us.\"\\nNader, according to one former diplomat, has a rare and valuable skill.\\n\"His stock in trade is access and influence,” the former diplomat said. “He finds a way to be valuable to people.”\\nBut Nader had dropped off the radar of many former associates two decades ago, including those who worked in Washington for his \"Middle East Insight\" magazine, which held many foreign policy discussions hosted by Nader and televised on C-Span until it folded around the time of his criminal conviction.\\n\"Until his name appeared recently, I had no idea that Mr. Nader was even alive,\" said one former writer at the magazine, who, like most of Nader\\'s associates, declined to be identified by name.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Alec, it was agony for those who were forced to watch. Bring back Darrell Hammond, funnier and a far greater talent! — Donald J.

Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2018\\nOne of those aides is Rob Porter, who resigned this week after his two former wives came forward and accused him of abusing them. On Friday night, The Washington Post first reported another White House aide, David Sorensen, resigned after his ex-wife accused him of abuse, including running over her foot with a car.\\nPorter\\'s first wife, Colbie Holderness, revealed an image of herself with a blackened eye in 2005, which she said she received from Porter punching her while they were on vacation in Florence, Italy. In June 2010, Porter\\'s second wife, Jennie Willoughby, filed an emergency protective order against Porter, whom she says dragged her naked from the shower.\\nPorter has denied the allegations.\\nIn the wake of the claims, the president wished Porter well on Friday, saying nothing of Porter\\'s accusers other than he was \"very sad\" to hear of the allegations.\\n\"He worked very hard,\" the president said in the Oval Office Friday. \"I found out about it recently and I was surprised by it. But we certainly wish him well. It\\'s obviously a tough time for him. He did a very good job when he was in the White House. And we hope he has a wonderful career, and hopefully he will have a great career ahead of him. But it was very sad when we heard about it, and certainly he\\'s also very sad. Now he also as you probably know, he says he\\'s innocent. And I think you have to remember that. He said very strongly yesterday that he\\'s innocent. So you\\'ll have to talk to him about that. But we absolutely wish him well. Did a very good job while he was at the White House.\"\\nThe White House\\'s response to the allegations leveled against Porter sent the White House scrambling. Porter warned White House counsel Don McGahn in January 2017 that there could be a holdup with his security clearance, CBS News has reported. In June 2017, Porter\\'s preliminary file was sent from the FBI to the White House security office. It contained information from his ex-wives alleging abuse. The file never went to McGahn personally, but it may have gone to another attorney in the White House counsel\\'s office. In September of 2017, Porter told McGahn the FBI had interviewed him a second time.\\nMcGahn became more clearly aware of the nature of those concerns in November 2017 when Porter\\'s former girlfriend called him to tell him of the abuse allegations from the former wives. Shortly after that, McGahn informed chief of staff John Kelly that there could be problems related to Porter\\'s security clearance. But, the White House took no action, waiting until after the Daily Mail reported the former wives\\' claims Tuesday night. White House communications director Hope Hicks, CBS News has confirmed, is dating Porter, although it\\'s unclear when she became aware of the allegations.\\nCBS News\\' Arden Farhi contributed to this report.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

So much Hennessy is being sold, in fact, that one New Hampshire official is asking the state Attorney General Gordon MacDonald to investigate whether the Liquor Commission is turning a blind eye to bootlegging and money-laundering activities.\\nNew Hampshire, despite its pronounced libertarian streak, is one of 17 \"control\" states, meaning the government manages the distribution of spirits. The state\\'s Liquor Commission, which is run by an appointed chairman, oversees 79 retail stores.\\nAndru Volinsky, a Democrat who serves on the state\\'s five-member Executive Council, an elected body that serves as a kind of watchdog over the executive branch, made the allegations public last month.\\nAfter being tipped off by a whistleblower, Volinsky says he recently witnessed two people who arrived in a vehicle with New York license plates spend approximately $24,000 on Hennessy products. At the register, they allegedly divided the sale into three transactions and paid using \"a very large wad of cash.\" He suspects people are buying up large quantities of New Hampshire\\'s tax-free booze to sell elsewhere.\\nThe IRS requires businesses to document when someone spends more than $10,000 in cash on a single purchase. By allowing customers to break up the transactions, Volinsky contends the Liquor Commission may be evading that reporting requirement. He\\'s also concerned that the Liquor Commission isn\\'t doing enough to police customers who may stop at multiple stores in a single day to avoid triggering the $10,000 reporting requirement.\\nThese practices \"may be illegal and unquestionably facilitate money laundering,\" writes Volinsky in a letter to the governor and state attorney general.\\nLiquor Commission denies allegations\\nThe New Hampshire Liquor Commission is a cash cow, generating more than $150 million in profits last year that went directly into the state\\'s general fund. These government-run liquor stores are strategically located near the state\\'s borders, including at highway rest stops, where motorists can enjoy tax-free shopping and better prices than in nearby Vermont and Massachusetts.\\nAccording to publicly available online inventories, those border stores stock huge quantities of Hennessy products. Meanwhile, just a handful of bottles may be on the shelves at stores located far from the border.\\nIt isn\\'t clear why Hennessy appears to be the brand of choice for bootleggers, but the price difference between New Hampshire\\'s bottles and the highly-taxed New York bottles is likely one draw. Also, government officials have offered anecdotal evidence that some of the booze is headed for Chinese restaurants, as well as gentleman\\'s clubs in the greater New York City region.\\n\"I started hearing anecdotes of people coming in with wads of cash stuffed in their socks,\" Volinsky tells New Hampshire Public Radio. \"Wads of cash that smell of perfume because on Wednesdays, apparently the strip club owners in New York come over to buy their liquor in bulk, and the office of the liquor store smells from the perfume.\"\\nFor its part, the Liquor Commission flatly denies Volinsky\\'s allegations.\\n\"There\\'s nothing illegal or unscrupulous about making large sales to out-of-state customers as long as our employees follow the policies in place set forth by the state and federal government,\" writes the commission in a statement. It has provided employees with a step-by-step guide to ensure financial disclosure laws are appropriately followed.\\nThe Commission, along with top Republicans in the state, including Governor Chris Sununu, have gone on the attack, criticizing Volinsky for his \"sting operation,\" and are calling for the attorney general to investigate him.\\nPrevious investigation\\nWhile a partisan tit-for-tat was perhaps inevitable, many of the concerns raised by Volinsky are not new to New Hampshire officials, or to law enforcement in neighboring states.\\nIn fact, in 2012, it was a top GOP lawmaker who called for a special House committee to investigate potential wrongdoing within the Liquor Commission, including how it handles large cash purchases.\\nThat committee\\'s final report included two anecdotes of out-of-state residents arrested in Massachusetts with large hauls of New Hampshire-purchased booze. One of those arrests included 1,676 bottles of Hennessy, bought at multiple locations. The driver was charged with possessing untaxed liquor and unlawfully transporting liquor.\\nMore recently, liquor enforcement officials in Vermont have made two arrests, one involving an estimated $40,000 worth of New Hampshire-purchased liquor in the back of an SUV, the other with an estimated $28,000 worth. Both suspects were charged with crossing state lines in possession of more than nine liters of alcohol, Vermont\\'s current legal limit.\\n\"The product that was the most prominent in both of these cases was Hennessy cognac,\" says Patrick Delaney, Vermont\\'s Commissioner of Liquor Control, who backs increasing the financial penalties for those caught illegally importing large quantities of liquor. He adds that \"by using cash, there is obviously no paper trail, if an authority were to investigate it. The activity itself is basically tax evasion.\"\\nAn IRS spokesperson says the agency is \"aware of this and similar schemes\" but wouldn\\'t confirm any active investigation into all-cash bulk transactions in New Hampshire.\\nPotential repercussions\\nPoliticians are not the only ones asking questions. Some employees of New Hampshire liquor stores are raising concerns about their role in processing these transactions.\\n\"They are starting to feel like a drug dealer,\" says Richard Gulla, president of the State Employees Association, the union which represents rank and file liquor store employees.\\nTo handle the huge stacks of cash and speed up transactions, the Liquor Commission has installed 20 bill-counting machines at stores around the state, and says it plans to roll out more units.\\nVolinsky sees these steps and others taken by the Liquor Commission as \"alarming.\"\\nThe state attorney general\\'s office says it is reviewing the documents submitted by Volinsky and isn\\'t yet able to comment on their contents.\\nNHPR\\'s Casey McDermott contributed to this report.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Return the cause and effect phrases.\\n\\n### Text:\\nBy Thomas Kennedy\\nEarly in 2017, Donald Trump signed an executive order threatening to rescind federal funds from local municipalities that refuse to criminalize immigrant communities. The executive order has suffered numerous legal setbacks since then, the most recent being a decision by a federal judge in California ruling it unconstitutional and issuing a permanent injunction, effectively blocking it.\\nDespite this, some lawmakers in Florida are attempting to pass dangerous legislation that threatens the wellbeing of immigrant families.\\nHouse Bill 9 (HB9) has been introduced by Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran and has so far been fast tracked through committee. The current Florida House of Representatives website currently has an ominous looking banner in its homepage, with information both about the bill and so called “sanctuary cities,” in what I interpret as a scare tactic.\\nAnti-immigrant legislation in Florida is not new. Immigration advocacy groups have been fighting against dangerous bills like HB9 for years, most memorably in 2011 when the state capitol in Tallahassee was flooded by activists from the Florida Immigrant Coalition who were taking part in a We Are Florida campaign and were able to stop an Arizona style “Show me your papers” law. Advocates have spent almost every legislative session since then fighting against the criminalization of immigrant families.\\nThe upcoming gubernatorial race, and especially the contested primary on the Republican side, is contributing to the urgency lawmakers seem to be feeling in Florida regarding anti-immigrant efforts. The Republican candidates seem to be in a competition to outdo each other in terms of who is the best adherent of Trumpism.\\nPerceived frontrunner Adam Putnam has downplayed support for legislation he once co-sponsored that would have allowed undocumented immigrants to work in the United States and receive a pathway to legal residency.\\nRep. Ron Desantis, who has won Trump’s endorsement, had this to say after Trump rescinded DACA, the executive order granting protection from deportation to thousands of undocumented students: “When he did it, how the media has reacted, how most politicians – Democrats and even a lot of Republicans – react; the sole focus is on what can Congress do to benefit an illegal immigrant?”\\nBut the current bill before Florida lawmakers takes anti-immigrant bias to new heights. The bill would discourage immigrants who are victims of a crime from cooperating with law enforcement agencies, would criminalize immigrant parents of U.S. citizens in Florida and would infringe on the power of local municipalities from enacting policies that would serve the best interests of their residents.\\nIn an editorial in the Tampa Bay Times, Corcoran said, “Our bill is simple: State and local governments must comply with and support the enforcement of federal immigration laws — end of story. Any elected officials who thinks they can circumvent the Constitution and the laws of our nation will face significant penalties, along with suspension or removal from office.”\\nThat is perhaps one of the most troubling aspects of the proposed law, it will leave elected officials who do not support the criminalization and deportation of immigrant families vulnerable to being removed from office. That is simply not in the spirit of American democracy, and would create a dangerous slippery slope in which authoritarians could use similar laws to silence their opposition. It simply cannot be allowed to happen.\\nHB9 cannot be allowed to pass by the Florida Legislature. It would make our communities less safe by eroding the trust between the public and law enforcement, would lead to the racial profiling and discrimination of immigrant communities, and would cost Florida residents thousands upon thousands of taxpayer dollars. Furthermore, studies have repeatedly found that municipalities and counties with sanctuary or welcoming policies are safer and have better economies than those without.\\nIn the past, bipartisan efforts by both Democrats and Republicans in the Florida Senate have defeated these anti-immigrant bills. Considering the current moment, we need state lawmakers to step up and do right by the most vulnerable communities in the state of Florida.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

That included prosecuting parents traveling with their children as well as people who subsequently attempted to request asylum.\\nWhite House officials have repeatedly acknowledged that under that new policy, they separate all families who cross the border. Sessions has described it as deterrence.\\nIn Their Own Words President Trump: \"The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility. ... Not on my watch.\" Attorney General Jeff Sessions: \"If you cross this border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It\\'s that simple. ... If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law. If you don\\'t like that, then don\\'t smuggle children over our border.\" Sessions on whether the policy is a deterrent: \"Yes, hopefully people will get the message and come through the border at the port of entry and not break across the border unlawfully.\" Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen: Under the \"zero tolerance\" policy, when families cross the border illegally, \"Operationally, what that means is we will have to separate your family. That\\'s no different than what we do every day in every part of the United States when an adult of a family commits a crime.\" White House Chief of Staff John Kelly: Separating families is \"a tough deterrent. ... The children will be taken care of — put into foster care or whatever. But the big point is they elected to come illegally into the United States and this is a technique that no one hopes will be used extensively or for very long.\"\\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection explains on its site and in a flyer that border-crossing families will be separated.\\nThe policy is unique to the Trump administration. Previous administrations did not, as a general principle, separate all families crossing the U.S. border illegally. And the current administration could choose to end this practice and release families together from detention at any time.\\nWhat happens when families are separated?\\nThe process begins at a Border Patrol detention facility. But many details about what happens next — how children are taken from their parents and by whom — are unclear.\\nAccording to the Texas Civil Rights Project, which has been able to speak with detained adults, multiple parents reported that they were separated from their children and not given any information about where their children would go. The organization also says that in some cases, the children were taken away under the pretense that they would be getting a bath.\\nThe Los Angeles Times spoke to unnamed Homeland Security officials who said parents are given information about the family separation process and that \"accusations of surreptitious efforts to separate are completely false.\"\\nFrom the point of separation forward, the policy for treating the separated children appears to be the same as existing systems for detaining and housing unaccompanied immigrant children — designed for minors who cross the border alone. Those unaccompanied minors are generally older than the children affected by family separation.\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption U.S. Customs and Border Protection\\'s Rio Grande Valley Sector via AP U.S. Customs and Border Protection\\'s Rio Grande Valley Sector via AP\\nWhere do the children go once they\\'ve been separated?\\nThe answer varies over time. Children begin at Border Patrol facilities, are transferred to longer-term shelters and are supposed to eventually be placed with families or sponsors. Here\\'s more about each step:\\nBorder Patrol facilities. If you\\'ve seen photos of children in what look like chain-link cages — whether unaccompanied minors in 2014 or separated children in 2018 — they are probably photos from a Border Patrol facility.\\nChildren usually are held here initially, but it is illegal to keep them for more than three days — these holding cells are not meant for long-term detainment.\\nThe Associated Press visited one site on Monday and described a \"large, dark facility\" with separate wings for children, adults and families:\\n\"Inside an old warehouse in South Texas, hundreds of children wait in a series of cages created by metal fencing. One cage had 20 children inside. Scattered about are bottles of water, bags of chips and large foil sheets intended to serve as blankets.\"\\nSuch facilities have been criticized before for poor conditions and reports of abuse and inhumane treatment, including a number of allegations the CBP strongly denies.\\nChild immigrant shelters. Within three days, children are supposed to be transferred from immigration detention to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services.\\nFor 15 years, ORR has handled the \"care and placement\" of unaccompanied migrant children. Until recently, that usually meant minors who crossed into the U.S. alone. Now it also includes children who have been separated from their families by authorities, including much younger children.\\nORR has a network of about 100 shelter facilities, all operated by nonprofit groups, where children are detained.\\nNPR\\'s John Burnett recently joined other reporters to visit one such facility, a converted Walmart Supercenter housing nearly 1,500 boys ages 10 to 17. Journalists\\' access to that facility in Brownsville, Texas, was limited, but the site was markedly different from Border Patrol facilities seen in photos released by the government — the teenage boys slept on beds instead of mats in the floor, in rooms instead of cages, and had access to classes and games.\\nORR says children remain at these shelters for \"fewer than 57 days on average.\" However some children have been kept detained for months longer than that, and some advocates say certain facilities improperly administer psychotropic medications.\\nObservers have raised concerns about the psychological toll on young children who enter this shelter system. NPR\\'s Joel Rose talked to one former shelter employee who said he quit after he was instructed to prevent siblings from hugging each other. The organization that runs the shelter said it allows touching and hugging in certain circumstances.\\nWhere are the girls and young children?\\nOfficial photos and videos have shown only older boys at shelter facilities.\\nHHS says there are specialized shelters for children under 13. No images from those shelters have been released, but authorities say new images and videos will be provided later this week.\\nMore than 10,000 migrant children, including children who crossed the border alone, are kept in ORR facilities. And existing facilities are filling up — the shelter Burnett visited was 95 percent full.\\nTent camps. A temporary facility has been set up in Tornillo, Texas, near El Paso. Little is known about the facility, and reporters have not been allowed outside, but KQED\\'s John Sepulvado has seen the tent from outside.\\n\"It\\'s a heavy-duty-grade white tent in the middle of a desert,\" he told NPR\\'s Here & Now. \"It\\'s behind two chain-link fences and there\\'s a dirt easement that\\'s on top of it so you can\\'t actually see into it from the American side.\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters\\n\"It\\'s not a city — there aren\\'t multiples of tents,\" he said. \"It\\'s just all one tent where these 16- and 17-year-olds are at.\"\\nIt\\'s not clear how many teenagers are inside, he says, but the government plans to expand it to hold some 4,000 detained minors.\\nThis is not the first time the U.S. government has used temporary shelters for minors: During the surge of unaccompanied minors crossing the border in 2014, HHS set up several temporary facilities at military bases.\\nSponsors or family members: Ultimately, ORR tries to find family members, foster parents or sponsors to take in children. Parents are the preferred option, but that\\'s not a possibility for children who have been separated from parents who remain in detention.\\nThere is no time limit on how long it can take to find a home for a child, but again, ORR says that on average the process takes less than two months.\\nBy law, those relatives or sponsors must, among other requirements, show that they can provide for the minor — sometimes verified with home visits — and ensure the minor\\'s attendance at any future court hearing.\\nThe Trump administration has said that it intends to subject sponsors to increased scrutiny.\\nUnder those new rules, the criminal background and immigration status of all sponsors, and any other adult living in the household, will be examined. Biometric data, such as fingerprints, also will be required. The checks will be performed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and not by ORR.\\nCritics say these new background checks will have a chilling effect.\\n\"Under the current circumstances and given the anti-immigrant rhetoric of the administration, it may be that few will be willing to come forward to claim children,\" said Bob Carey, who was director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement under the Obama administration.\\nCan parents who are prosecuted be reunited with their children?\\nParents face a court hearing where, as NPR\\'s John Burnett has reported, they may face objections from prosecutors if their lawyers try to bring up their children in a bid for leniency.\\nIf parents are eventually released from detention, they will be able to take custody of their own children, Nielsen said at a news conference Monday.\\nICE instructions on how to find a separated child The Immigration and Customs Enforcement call center is available M-F, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET, at 1-888-351-4024 (or 9116# from within an ICE facility)\\nParents can call the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which operates shelters, at 1-800-203-7001 (or 699# from within an ICE detention facility)\\nFriends, family and advocates can email ICE at Parental.Interests@ice.dhs.gov or ORR at information@ORRNCC.com\\nIn a statement to NPR, ICE expanded on the process of family reunification.\\nDuring a parent\\'s detention, \"ICE and ORR will work together to locate separated children, verify the parent/child relationship, and set up regular communication and removal coordination, if necessary,\" ICE says. A hotline has been set up to help parents and children find each other.\\n\"ICE will make every effort to reunite the child with the parent once the parent\\'s immigration case has been adjudicated,\" a spokesman said. Parents being deported may request that their children leave with them, or may decide to leave the child in the U.S. to pursue their own immigration claim, ICE says. For instance, they might suggest another family member in the U.S. to sponsor their child, as described above.\\nHowever, The New Yorker spoke to lawyers and advocates who said there is no formal process or clear protocol for tracking parents and children within the system, and that chaotic systems and inadequate record-keeping make it difficult even to know which facility a child might be kept at.\\nAnd The New York Times reports that some parents have been deported without their children, against their will.\\nWhat is the law regarding the treatment of migrant children?\\nA two-decade-old court settlement, the Flores settlement, and a law called the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (or TVPRA) both specify how the government must treat migrant children.\\nThey require that migrant children be placed in \"the least restrictive environment,\" or sent to live with family members. They also limit how long families with children can be detained; courts have interpreted that limit as 20 days.\\nPrevious administrations have released families to meet these requirements. President Trump has said the law requires him to separate families, which is not true. His advisers have presented a more complicated argument for how the law requires family separation.\\n\"The laws prohibit us from detaining families while they go through prosecution,\" Homeland Secretary Nielsen said on Monday — a reference to the 20-day limits on how long children can be detained. Therefore, she says, \"we cannot detain families together.\"\\nShe argues that that leaves the administration with the options of not enforcing the law, which they reject, or separating families. But immigration advocates and legal experts say that there are other options, including those previous administrations have chosen.\\nWhat was the policy under President Obama?\\nThe Obama administration established family detention centers that kept families together while their cases were processed.\\nHowever, those centers were sharply criticized for keeping children detained even if they were still with their parents. A court ruled that those detention centers violated the Flores agreement and that families should be released together.\\nThe Obama White House also had a policy of releasing families through a program called Alternatives to Detention that still allowed them to be closely supervised — for instance, by giving mothers ankle monitors before releasing them.\\nThe ACLU welcomed the Alternatives to Detention program but other immigrant rights groups had reservations.\\nAs NPR\\'s John Burnett reported, one for-profit prison company that was making money off immigrant detention was also profiting off those ankle monitor systems.\\nICE tells NPR that the Alternatives to Detention program is still active under the Trump administration, but Trump has repeatedly said he opposes what he denounces as \"catch-and-release.\"\\nCan families claim asylum, allowing them to stay together?\\nHypothetically, yes. In practice, maybe not.\\nFamilies that claim asylum at ports of entry are meant to be kept together while their claims are processed.\\nBut there is evidence that even families who seek asylum at ports of entry are being separated. One high-profile case involves a Congolese woman who sought asylum and still was separated from her 7-year-old daughter. In February, NPR\\'s Burnett reported on the legal battle of Ms. L v. ICE.\\nWhat is asylum? Claiming asylum means asking the U.S. to accept you — legally — because of persecution you\\'re facing in your home country. Crossing the border illegally is a misdemeanor; for a person who\\'s already been deported once, it\\'s a felony. Both types of crimes are currently being prosecuted with no exceptions, even if a person later claims asylum. Claiming asylum at a port of entry, however, is not a crime at all.\\nHers is not an isolated case, according to immigrant advocates.\\n\"Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service has documented 53 incidents of family separation in the last nine months, mostly Central Americans. Other immigrant support groups say there are many more cases,\" Burnett reported.\\nReporter Jean Guerrero of KPBS in San Diego reported on the case of a Salvadoran father, Jose Demar Fuentes, who says he sought asylum and was separated from his 1-year-old son, Mateo, despite having an original birth certificate proving that he is the boy\\'s father.\\nIn a White House press briefing Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said, \"DHS is not separating families legitimately seeking asylum at ports of entry.\" But she said DHS \"will only separate a family if we cannot determine there is a familial relationship, if child is at risk with the parent or legal guardian, or if the parent or legal guardian is referred for prosecution.\"\\nBurnett also has reported that some families are not being allowed to claim asylum — that they are being repeatedly turned away and told the CBP facility is too full to accept them.\\nNielsen has denied that some asylum-seekers who present themselves at a port of entry are being turned away, which would be a violation of international law.\\n\"We are saying we want to take care of you in the right way. Right now we do not have the resources at this particular moment in time. Come back,\" she said.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

This time: an influential research project on growth mindset\\nThere is a wealth of psychology research that can help teachers to improve how they work with students, but academic studies of this kind aren’t always easy to access or translate into the realities of classroom practice. This series seeks to redress that by taking a selection of studies and making sense of the important information for teachers, as we all seek to answer the question: how can we help our students do better at school? This time, we consider growth mindset.\\nGrowth mindset – the idea that intelligence can be developed rather than it being set in stone – is arguably the most popular psychological theory in education at the moment. It was launched into mainstream consciousness after a seminal growth mindset study almost 20 years ago and has since spawned many assemblies and form tutor-time activities. But what were the findings of this influential study?\\nThe problem with praise such as \\u200b\\u200b'you're so clever\\u200b' is that it doesn't tell students what they need to do next time\\nWriting in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 1998, Claudia Mueller and Carol Dweck from Columbia University, New York, explored the consequences of how different types of praise affected students. The research paper is actually a combination of six separate studies.\\nIn each, students aged nine to 12 years old completed a problem-solving game. They were then told they’d got 80% of the questions right and were praised for either their natural intelligence or how hard they worked on the task. The researchers reported on how the students felt, thought and behaved in subsequent tasks.\\nWhat are the main findings?\\nChildren who were praised for their intelligence were more likely to choose future tasks that they thought would make them look smart. Children who had been praised for their effort tended to choose tasks that would help them learn new things.\\nChildren praised for their intelligence said they enjoyed the task less when compared to the children who had been praised for their effort.\\nChildren praised for their intelligence were less likely to persist on tasks than the children who had been praised for their effort.\\nChildren who had been praised for their intelligence performed worse in future tasks. The children who had been praised for their effort performed better in future tasks.\\nThe majority (86%) of children praised for their intelligence asked for information about how their peers did on the same task. Only 23% of children who had been praised for effort asked for this type of feedback – most of them asked for feedback about how they could do better.\\nA significant proportion (38%) of children praised for their ability lied about the number of problems they solved in the task. Only 13% of the children praised for effort did the same.\\nRelated research\\nIn the intervening years, the impact of growth mindset has been studied by many different researchers around the world. The overwhelming majority of these have found that having a growth mindset is associated with getting better grades. Some of these studies included a very large sample size, of more than 100,000 students. However, two recent studies paint a slightly more cloudy picture.\\nGrowth mindset: practical tips you may not have tried yet Read more\\nIn England, researchers found that improvements in English and maths [pdf] attributed to growth mindset interventions (on average, students made two months’ additional progress) could have been down to chance. The other study, involving 222 students in China, found no relationship between student mindset and their academic performance.\\nBut beyond improved attainment, research suggests having a growth mindset has other advantages, including coping better with transition, higher self-regulation, grit and pro-social behaviours. There is also evidence suggesting mental health benefits – those with a growth mindset have been found to be less aggressive, with higher self-esteem and fewer symptoms associated with depression and anxiety.\\nWhat does this mean for the classroom?\\nThis study highlights the complexities and importance of how we deliver feedback. The problem with praise such as “you’re so clever” or “you must be so talented” is that it doesn’t tell students what they need to do next time.\\nBy praising their effort and the strategies they used, we give students a template of behaviour to follow. As the authors of the study noted: “Children exposed to this intelligence feedback were likely to respond negatively when they faced achievement setbacks … children given effort feedback, who valued learning over performance, were less likely to fall apart when they experienced an isolated low performance.” Studies like this must therefore make us consider the merit of calling certain students “gifted and talented”.\\nIt’s also worth being aware of the ways in which the idea of growth mindset is sometimes misunderstood. In the rush to embrace it as a method, the message has sometimes been diluted to “growth mindset is all about effort” or morphed into “anyone can do anything” – neither of which is accurate or helpful. Having a growth mindset is about the belief that someone can learn and improve. To help shape students’ behaviours and mindsets, teachers should look to develop a consistent culture of high expectations and quality feedback.\\n• Bradley Busch is a registered psychologist, director at InnerDrive and author of Release Your Inner Drive.

Return the cause and effect phrases.\\n\\n### Text:\\nThere’s been so much going on in recent weeks that it’s hard to remember that the biggest story in the world is the rapid rise of China.\\nYes, it’s fascinating to see what’s happening with the Trump-Kim Summit in Singapore, or at the Trump vs. Trudeau Smackdown in Canada, or to peek into the the bottomless Swampathon of Washington, DC. Yet still, while it’s not always atop the headlines, the most consequential story of the age is the rise and rise of the People’s Republic.\\nAnd perhaps the fate of a city in Brazil serves as a parable as to what could be looming for our American republic. Virgil will get to that scary parable in a moment, but first, let’s consider the latest news.\\nAn Artful Deal with China—But Artful for Whom?\\nOn June 12, China’s telecom giant ZTE announced it is resuming business operations, after having been staved off some U.S. sanctions that could have shut it down completely. A bipartisan group of US Senators is still struggling to toughen up those sanctions, and so it’s unclear what will happen next, but it seems likely, in the end, that ZTE will wriggle out of the most serious possible punishment. Which is to say, how long do you think it will be before ZTE is back up to its old tricks?\\nIn other words, the Chinese seem to be showing that they understand, too, 交易的艺术—The Art of the Deal.\\nAnd speaking of deals, late last month, National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow said the administration was “making terrific progress” in its trade talks with China, aimed at lowering the U.S. trade deficit with that country, currently running at $375 billion annually. That same day, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, “We’re putting the trade war on hold,” pending possible progress.\\nOf course, some were skeptical—even in surprising places. For instance, also late last month, The Washington Post headlined, “China is winning Trump’s trade war.” Yes, we know where the “Bezos Post” is coming from, but still, the story quoted a number of experts and politicians, all of whom argued that the Chinese are likely to be unyielding on key trade issues, such as manufacturing exports and the protection of U.S. intellectual property (IP). And the Post cited the administration’s own estimate that China is stealing between $225 billion and $600 billion worth of our IP each year. We might pause to observe that it’s these matters of technological know-how that are the crux of national power—even national survival.\\nInterestingly, this somber realization is starting to penetrate Beltway thinking. For instance, a recent headline atop Axios, the buzzy Beltway publication, was veritably Trumpian: “1 big thing: The greatest, growing threat to America.” The article detailed China’s 2025 Plan, which calls for the country “to dominate all futuristic advanced technologies such as robotics, A.I., aviation and space, driverless or new energy vehicles.” The conclusion is inescapable: If the Chinese beat us in all those categories, they beat us, period.\\nOf course, Donald Trump has been sounding exactly this alarm for decades, even when the bipartisan Establishment was swooning over the mirage of globalism. Giving credit where credit is due, the author of the piece, Jim VandeHei—one of the most influential journalists in Washington, DC—added a note about the 45th President: “Trump showed you can turn China into a villain on trade.” Looking beyond Trump, VandeHei added: “A smart politician could turn China into a unifying villain on virtually every topic—a reason to move fast and together on infrastructure, immigration, regulations, space, robotics, 5G and next-gen education.”\\nIn other words, the threat from China could finally galvanize the U.S. to do the things that we should have been doing all along.\\nAnd so it was interesting to see that at the moment that the importance of technology was being acknowledged, the breaking news from the White House was about agriculture; on May 21, Trump tweeted the news:\\nChina has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products – would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years!\\nYes, undoubtedly the President is correct when he says that this deal would be one the best thing to happen to US farmers—and farmers and their farms are certainly important; we do, after all, have to eat. However, as we have seen, the most profound concerns are elsewhere. What matters most to our national destiny is tech, not ag.\\nVirgil doesn’t often find himself agree with Sen. Chuck Schumer, but the New York Democrat had a piercing point when he jibed soon thereafter:\\nChina’s trade negotiators must be laughing themselves all the way back to Beijing. They’re playing us for fools — temporary purchase of some goods, while China continues to steal our family jewels, the things that have made America great: the intellectual property, the know-how in the highest end industries.\\nVirgil will leave it to others to assess Schumer’s credibility on this issue; for sure, he seems more critical of Trump than he was of, say, Barack Obama. And yet also for sure, he’s right about this much: The ultimate issue in national prosperity, even national survival, is know-how. That is, do we know how to do something better than our economic and military rivals? And a look back at history drills that point home—you have to stay ahead of the competition.\\nSilicon Valley, Meet Manaus, Brazil\\nNobody should ever make the mistake of thinking that anything about the economy is permanent. That is, the economy is always churning and changing; some players are winning, and some are losing. Moreover, the same holds true for society and, indeed, for history itself; one empire rises, another falls. And it’s hard to say that any country is immune, not even the United States.\\nA classic expression of this waxing and waning is the 1818 poem by Percy Shelley, Ozymandias. That work describes a traveler trekking through the desert, coming across the remains of a once-towering statue:\\nAnd on the pedestal, these words appear:\\nMy name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;\\nLook on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!\\nThe poem concludes on a somber note:\\nNothing beside remains. Round the decay\\nOf that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare\\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\\nOzymandias, by the way, was a real king. His name is better known to us as Ramses II; he was a pharaoh in Egypt’s glory days, when Egypt was arguably the world’s leading civilization. And yet now…\\nSuch gloomy thoughts, about the death of kings and kingdoms, were brought to Virgil’s mind by a recent headline, “In Silicon Valley, Chinese ‘accelerators’ aim to bring startups home.” The Reuters article details the efforts of the People’s Republic of China to invest in and learn from—some would say, steal from—the greatest U.S. tech firms.\\nSen. Mark Warner (D-VA), vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, outlined the risk:\\nOur intellectual property is the future of our economy and our security. China’s government has clearly prioritized acquiring as much of that intellectual property as possible. Their ongoing efforts, legal or illegal, pose a risk that we have to look at very seriously.\\nWe might emphasize Warner’s use of the word “illegal.” Why, he might even agree with the Trump administration’s estimate that China steals as much as $600 billion of our intellectual property every year. In fact, that same day, May 17, the President himself declared, “We have been ripped off by China”—and this only hours before a visit to the White House by Chinese vice premier Liu He.\\nSo what could happen to the US if this thievery continues? Today, without a doubt, the US enjoys tech pre-eminence. The largest of our tech titans, the so-called GAFA companies—Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon—have a total market capitalization of more than $2.4 trillion, vastly greater than that of the Chinese tech companies.\\nOf course, as we all know, China is catching up fast—in everything. Just a decade ago, China’s GDP was less than a third of America’s, and yet if current growth rates continue—the U.S. at around 2 percent, and China at around 6.5 percent—China will overtake the U.S. in 2027. If that projection proves true, then America’s tech edge could vanish just as surely as that statue of Ozymandias.\\nIn fact, if we want a glimpse of what a possible future might look like, we might take a look at Manaus, Brazil. That city’s bitter history illustrates what can happen when someone steals away your economic mojo.\\nToday, Manaus is just another Brazilian city, population 2.1 million. And yet in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was one of the boom cities of the world, based on a supremely valuable product: rubber.\\nThe peoples of the Amazon had long known that a viscous substance, latex, could be tapped from the Hevea brasiliensis tree; they had found occasional uses for it when it dried into rubber.\\nYet natural rubber had a problem: It invariably turned gooey in the summer and brittle in the winter, and so it wasn’t good for much. But all that changed after 1839, when the American inventor Charles Goodyear figured out how to “vulcanize”—that is, permanently weatherproof—latex rubber.\\nGoodyear’s vulcanization opened up new vistas for the use for rubber; it was now not just a curiosity, but a valuable commodity. And so all of a sudden, in the mid 19th century, attention—and money—turned to the source of that rubber, the Amazon rain forest. And in the middle was Manaus. Thus that city fluked its way into a worldwide monopoly on rubber production.\\nLocal land-owners—we might call them “Rubber Barons”—got rich quick, and then some. And amidst the riotous luxury of life at the top—Manaus was said to lead the world in both diamond-purchasing and brothel-patronizing—a few noble and lasting structures were created, such as the Manaus Opera House. When that grand edifice was completed in 1896, it ranked as one of the largest theaters in the world.\\nYet then came nemesis for Manaus. Just as the folks there were living it up, their competitive advantage was winding down. Or, more precisely, it was sailing away across the Pacific, gone to Asia.\\nIn 1876, a wily British agriculturalist, Henry Wickham, came to Manaus and left with 70,000 Hevea seeds. His goal was profitable nationalism; he would take the seeds to a British colony and plant them there, so that rubber production could thrive under the Union Jack, not under the mostly green-and-yellow flag of Brazil.\\nIt took a few decades to get the hang of rubber-growing in a non-native climate, but soon enough, British planters succeeded in growing rubber in two of their colonies, Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Malaya (Malaysia).\\nIndeed the British, with their superior sense of industry, had actually improved on the Brazilians. Whereas in Manaus the rubber workers simply went out into the wild looking for trees to tap, the Brits established efficient rubber plantations.\\nThus Brazil lost its monopoly profits. By 1910, Brazilian production had fallen to 50 percent of the world market; by 1918, it was down to 20 percent, and in 1940, it was barely more than one percent. Manaus’ opera-house-building days were over. (Since then, of course, synthetic rubber, a technology pioneered in the U.S. during World War Two, has taken over.)\\nOkay, so there you have the doomsday scenario: Silicon Valley could end up suffering the fate of Manaus, with the Chinese today playing the role of the British yesterday.\\nVirgil is not arguing that Silicon Valley could become another Manaus as the Chinese eat our lunch—at least not right away. Yet over time, as we have seen, anything can happen. Just as world history is full of rich empires that have fallen by the wayside—from ancient Egypt to dear old Rome—so, too, it is full of rich economies that fell, and couldn’t get up.\\nOf course, some will insist that the similarities between Manaus, then, and Silicon Valley, now, are much less than the dissimilarities. That is, they insist, It can’t happen here.\\nTo which there’s only thing to say: We’ll find out.\\nAnd of this much, Virgil is sure: The world has not seen its last Ozymandias.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

(He did not mention that it is the N.R.A. that is precipitating such court rulings by suing the State of Florida over its new gun purchasing age.)\\nThe president’s retreat is a stark reminder — if anyone in Washington needed one — that the gun debate remains stuck where it has been for more than a decade.

On Monday, she accused the president of having “completely caved to the gun lobby.”\\nThe idea of arming teachers is vigorously opposed by many members of both parties, law enforcement officials and groups representing the nation’s teachers. But it has been pushed for years by the N.R.A., which argues that arming school officials is the best way to protect students and teachers against a well-armed attacker. “The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun,” the N.R.A. mantra has gone.\\nThe White House on Sunday proposed creating the Federal Commission on School Safety, which would study the question of raising the minimum age for purchasing rifles. That proposal came just a day after Mr. Trump himself mocked the idea of federal commissions as ineffective.\\n“We can’t just keep setting up blue-ribbon committees,” Mr. Trump said during a political rally on Saturday. The president said that members of such commissions do little more than “talk, talk, talk” and then, “two hours later, then they write a report.”\\nOn Capitol Hill, the energy has largely dissipated for the kind of expansive gun control legislation that Mr. Trump appeared to support earlier this month. With such legislation stalled, Republican leaders are instead turning their attention toward less contentious measures that would beef up security at the nation’s schools.\\nPhoto\\nThe only gun-related measure that appears to stand a chance of passage this year is the so-called Fix NICS Act, a narrow N.R.A.-backed bill that would improve data reporting to the national background check database. The House has already passed it, as part of a broader bill that includes one of the N.R.A.’s highest priorities: a sharp expansion of the right to carry concealed weapons almost anywhere in the country.\\nThe Senate’s chief sponsor of Fix NICS, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chamber’s No. 2 Republican, said in an interview last week that he had not spoken to the N.R.A. about it. He sees the bill as a way to bridge the partisan divide, though critics note that it would only enforce existing law.\\n“It really to me is simple,” Mr. Cornyn said. “Do people want their whole laundry list of things done and end up empty-handed? That’s what usually happens. If you say, ‘I want 100 percent of what I want or nothing,’ we invariably end up with nothing.”\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nBut even Fix NICS is stuck. The bill has 61 co-sponsors in addition to Mr. Cornyn — two more than the 60 votes required to break a Senate filibuster. But at least two Republicans, and possibly a third, are blocking the Republican leadership from bringing the bill to the floor quickly for a vote.\\nSchool safety measures, meanwhile, are moving forward. The Republican-controlled House is expected to vote Wednesday on the STOP School Violence Act, which would authorize $50 million annually for safety improvements, including training teachers and students in how to prevent violence and developing anonymous reporting systems for threats of school violence.\\nIn the Senate, a companion bill would also give schools money for physical improvements, such as metal detectors or bulletproof windows and doors.\\nAnd even if Senate leaders were inclined to bring up gun legislation for a vote, they are short on time. This week, the Senate is considering a measure to ease banking regulations, and next week senators will be working against a deadline to pass a catchall spending measure to fund the government; the current spending bill expires on March 23. After that, the Senate will be in recess for two weeks.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Most producers say their oil is made from hemp, a plant in the cannabis family that contains little THC and can be legally farmed in a number of states for clothing, food and other uses.\\nThe immediate impact of Monday\\'s approval on these products is unclear.\\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb suggested the agency would be scrutinizing CBD products with \"uncertain dosages and formulations.\"\\n\"We are prepared to take action when we see the illegal marketing of CBD-containing products with serious, unproven medical claims,\" Gottlieb said in a statement.\\nThe FDA previously issued warnings to CBD producers that claimed their products could treat specific diseases, such as cancer or Alzheimer\\'s. Only products that have received formal FDA approval can make such claims, typically requiring clinical trials costing millions.\\nMost CBD producers sidestep the issue by making only broad claims about general health and well-being.\\nIndustry supporters downplayed the impact of the FDA approval.\\n\"I don\\'t know a mom or dad in their right mind who is going to change what\\'s already working,\" said Heather Jackson, CEO of Realm of Caring, a charitable group affiliated with Colorado-based CW Hemp, one of nation\\'s largest CBD companies. \"I really don\\'t think it\\'s going to affect us much.\"\\nJackson\\'s group estimates the typical family using CBD to treat childhood epilepsy spends about $1,800 per year on the substance.\\nA GW Pharmaceuticals spokeswoman said the company would not immediately announce a price for the drug, which it expects to launch in the fall. Wall Street analysts have previously predicted it could cost $25,000 per year, with annual sales eventually reaching $1 billion.\\nFor their part, GW Pharmaceuticals executives say they are not trying to disrupt products already on the market. The company has pushed legislation in several states to make sure its drug can be legally sold and prescribed.\\nThe FDA approval for Epidiolex is technically limited to patients with Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, two rare forms of epilepsy for which there are few treatments. But doctors will have the option to prescribe it for other uses.\\nThe new medication enters an increasingly complicated legal environment for marijuana.\\nNine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use. Another 20 states allow medical marijuana, but the U.S. government continues to classify it as a controlled substance with no medical use, in the same category as heroin and LSD.\\nDespite increasing acceptance, there is little rigorous research on the benefits and harms of marijuana. Last year a government-commissioned group concluded that the lack of scientific information about marijuana and CBD poses a risk to public health.\\nBefore sales of Epidiolex can begin, the Drug Enforcement Administration must formally reclassify CBD into a different category of drugs that have federal medical approval.\\nGW Pharmaceuticals makes the drug in the U.K. from cannabis plants that are specially bred to contain high levels of CBD. And the company plans to continue importing the medicine, bypassing onerous U.S. regulations on manufacturing restricted substances.\\n———\\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\\'s Department of Science Education.

In nearly all of them their voices are breaking, they scream with rage, then they pause to gulp air and weep. They are riding the thinnest crest of a wave between abject grief, righteous anger and political will, seeming at any point as if they may by dumped by the weight of their own emotion. Yet despite this, they are able to argue their case in simple terms and identify the weakest link in the oft-perfected Republican script following a mass shooting.\\nPerhaps the most crucial thing that makes them effective advocates for change is the belief that change is possible\\nAt a televised debate, for example, when Marco Rubio tried his usual “this is a tough issue, gun control won’t stop someone like this” spiel, student Cameron Kasky was meticulous. He first lavished praise on the senator for showing up and then asked him, repeatedly, whether he would refuse money from the NRA. It immediately exposed Rubio’s fraudulence, using sympathetic language with the students while still taking donations from rabid gun advocates. Rubio couldn’t find a workable response as jeers rang round the stadium.\\nMost shootings like this stay in the news for a few days, normally accompanied by a half-hearted gun control debate, before falling further and further down homepages. So how have these students been able to progress this issue when so many before them have failed?\\nPart of the reason is demographics: none of the children killed in the Sandy Hook school shooting of 2012 were over seven years old; these are middle-class students preparing for college. Their school was a place where political debate was encouraged, and there had been plenty of on-campus debates about gun rights when it was still an abstract issue for most of the students.\\nOf course, many of America’s most effective pieces of activism have come from its most disenfranchised citizens, but as Trevor Noah, host of the Daily Show, put it: “A lot of these kids come from wealthy backgrounds. The school in Parkland is in an affluent neighbourhood … This is people using their privilege, if that makes sense. Because these kids are like, ‘No, I don’t accept this world.’ And the parents and the politicians are like, ‘Well that’s not how it works.’ And they’re like, ‘Well you need to change it. I don’t care. I want to see the manager.’”\\nBoth the media and the students themselves have suggested that the reason they’re being listened to is because they have grown up digital natives and they have been able to harness the power of social media. While it’s true that internet access will have exposed them to the power and techniques of activism, it does these teenagers a disservice to say they are merely wily online operatives. If anything, their success has been to avoid keeping protest inside echo chambers on Twitter and Snapchat, and reach out to normal Americans on TV news and mainstream shows like Ellen and the Today Show. Even in Britain, they have been a constant feature of Radio 4 news shows and the evening news on every channel. They have shrewdly understood that all media outlets are all hungry for access to the victims, and if they are willing to sacrifice their right to private grieving, there will not be a shortage of places willing to give them a platform.\\nAnother smart move was to set the date of their planned nationwide anti-gun protest more than a month after the shooting, giving the story an extended news cycle and infuriating the gun lobby which had hoped that national anger would dissipate as it had in the past.\\nBut perhaps the most crucial thing that makes them effective advocates for change is the basic belief that change is possible. One of the defining malaises of our age is the feeling that we can do nothing about the horrors we are exposed to every day. The American psychologist Martin Seligman called it “learned helplessness”, the documentarian Adam Curtis called it “oh dearism” – it is a feeling that intensifies over decades of repeated failures: if you have seen enough cases of police brutality, or horrifying wars in the Middle East or mass shootings you start to believe that nothing will ever change.\\nThese students are not only too young to have lived through the many times this has happened before, they have also grown up in an era of radical change: the first black president, the first president with no political experience, the legalisation of gay marriage and, yes, the rise of social media and its ability to give a voice to anyone. They have not yet succumbed to the idea that nothing can be done.\\nOprah compares Florida shooting activists to civil rights pioneers Read more\\nOne of their most popular chants, heard at rallies and vigils, ringing around the American news channels and no doubt in the White House, is “we have a voice”. On paper it seems like an odd phrase: it’s non-specific, it doesn’t demand anything of any power like most protest slogans do. But when you see it spat from the mouths of otherwise peaceful young people, you realise it’s not aimed at any one lawmaker, but the fabric of reality itself.\\nThese survivors are experiencing their agency, destroying the very deep psychological barrier that says no person can change certain inalienable truths about American politics, reminding themselves that every great change in history happened just after a thousand missed opportunities when things stayed exactly the same.\\n• Sam Wolfson is a freelance journalist\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Clean energy offers billions in potential investment and thousands of jobs for regional Queensland. But it also faces on-the-ground challenges, including turf wars with intensive farming that threaten to hamper the energy sector’s transition.\\nSign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon\\nAsh’s decision to offer up part of his Mirani property for solar has made him something of a divisive figure locally. Two fellow growers objected, as did the company that buys and refines his cane, Mackay Sugar. Mackay regional council, whose planning officers had backed the project, voted to reject the application. Legal action is afoot.\\nWhenever he’s asked about the state of the sugar industry or the challenges faced by cane growers, Ash just makes a downward motion with his arm.\\nHe wanders around his block, pointing to patches of standover cane – left unharvested from the previous season – where solar panels will ultimately be placed. He says part of the field to be given to the solar company was planted with cane just four years ago.\\n“If I had my time over again I wouldn’t have planted it, the way the industry has gone,” Ash says. “When [the solar plan] come around, the way the industry was going, it was going backwards and it was one way of diversifying into something that’s friendly, it’s not going to do harm.\\n“And if it doesn’t work, well, they’ll reinstate the ground back to how it was. You’re not putting it under cement or doing that sort of thing.”\\n‘It’s a very sunny place’\\nModelling released by the Climate Institute last year showed Queensland had the potential to power 4m homes through renewable energy projects and create more than 7,000 jobs over the next decade, many of them in north and central Queensland where many local economies are struggling with high unemployment and the hit-and-miss legacies of mining and gas booms. The number of jobs on offer is considerably more than at Adani’s Carmichael coalmine, a project touted by many in these parts as an economic saviour.\\nAndrew Stock, an energy expert and councillor for the Climate Council, says about $1.6bn of renewable investment is being built in Queensland.\\n“Obviously ... it’s a very sunny place so solar projects both large and small, are very well suited to Queensland and north Queensland,” he says. “The amount of energy they can generate ... is among the highest output of any solar farms in Australia.”\\nThe clean energy regulator says the government’s 2020 renewable energy target has effectively been met by projects either built or under construction. Incentives have led to an industry boom but there is a danger it will shift to bust without changes to policy settings and planning regulations that could threaten the pace of the renewable transition.\\nStock says the federal government’s national energy guarantee is “woefully inadequate” and will bring forward no new renewable energy capacity over the next decade.\\n“If electricity demand doesn’t grow, and no existing coal plants shut, the modelling by the energy security board last year shows there are virtually no new renewables ... that need to be built,” he says.\\n“And that’s potentially a problem for renewables, that pipeline of investment projects, probably between $7bn to $10bn worth of investment, many thousands of jobs ... and that’s all put at risk because under the Neg, the emissions reduction requirements mean that there’s virtually no new renewable capacity that’s needed.”\\nFrom overhead, the cane fields are a mesmerising combination of bright green and right angles, stretching for country miles. About 300km to the north of Mirani, near the banks of the Burdekin River, patterned rows of black panels suddenly consume the landscape.\\nThe Clare solar farm is the state’s largest, and last month was connected to the energy grid. In 2015 it caused angst among cane growers and was subject to a legal challenge led by the local milling company, Wilmar, until being “called in” by the state government, a process that overrides local planners on matters of state significance.\\nThe same conflict between sugar and solar has been repeated at Mirani, and will be again.\\n“The Queensland government has a very strong policy of supporting solar renewables in general,” says Georgina Davis, senior policy adviser for the Queensland Farmers’ Federation. “They didn’t make provision to plan where they would go. They’ve let that be a market-driven process.\\n“It’s just been an unfortunate sort of effect that some of those sites have been on [good quality] agricultural land. Their primary focus is looking for a piece of land that has a willing seller or a willing renter, and that has the access to infrastructure they need.”\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Part of the huge solar farm at Clare. Photograph: Jack Tran\\nSolar projects are more efficient, and more profitable, the closer they are built to existing substations, which means proponents have targeted certain blocks. The Australian Energy Market Operator issues ratings called “marginal loss factors” which score renewable projects based on local demand and effectively determine how much energy that project can feed into the grid.\\n“The adoption and interest in large-scale solar has been so quick, and it has had to be quick,” Davis says. “A lot of them have been in a rush to get these facilities up compared to their competitors ... Once that capacity is gone, it’s gone.”\\nAlthough the operation of the energy market has exacerbated land-use conflicts, planning policies also lack consistency when it comes to land disputes between agriculture and renewables.\\nThe Queensland state planning policy lists enabling renewable energy projects as a priority. It also aims to minimise “encroachment on agricultural resources to ensure viable tracts of agricultural land are maintained”.\\nThe farmers’ federation and the farm lobby group AgForce have called for a solar code that provides protection for high-quality land and establishes rehabilitation bonds, similar to those for mining tenements. Graziers are worried about the effect of power lines connecting some facilities, and farmers are in some cases uncomfortable that they are close to projects.\\n‘The industry has got a lot to prove yet’\\nThe Mackay mayor, Greg Williamson, says his council would have supported a solar farm proposal had it been on “rubbish land” but state policies required it to consider the agricultural impacts.\\n“It doesn’t matter whether it’s the one that’s being contested now or not,” he says. “If it’s growing 9,000 to 10,000 tonne of cane a year and it [is good quality agricultural land], we’re obliged to consider that. And really nothing else trumps it.”\\nEven if state government policy did not mandate the consideration of agricultural land, the council’s priority is sugar, rather than solar, Williamson says. The council has “nothing against solar” and considered building its own solar farm, but found ultimately it would not produce savings to justify the investment. Instead, the region is putting panels at individual council sites.\\n“We don’t want a future for our industry to be less cane farms and to grow solar panels,” he says. “We want more sugar to be produced. We want to grow more sugar for the right outcomes.”\\nStock says communities such as Mackay, which is a hub for the Bowen basin’s coalmines, should be among the first to embrace the opportunities provided by renewables. They should “start to plan that transition in an orderly way so they don’t end up being faced with really quite dramatic shocks to regional employment when mines close”.\\nWilliamson, who argues that Australia should have invested in new coal-fired power stations, bristles at that suggestion.\\n“Well, mate, hang on,” he says. “Queensland generates 14.8 gigawatts of power to run every day and less than 5% has been generated by solar. The industry has got a lot to prove yet.\\n“From a council perspective, we have an industry [sugar] that produces $400m to $500m a year for our valley, for our region ... It is not fair to level at council a head-in-the-sand attitude about renewable energy ... when we have a vested interest in protecting an industry that provides millions and millions of dollars to this district.”\\nFor Colin Ash, that same industry, the one he’s worked in for a lifetime, is getting to the point where he’s struggling to make ends meet. Like many other growers he has everything – his income, and his ability to fund his retirement – invested in the land.\\n“It’s not a goldmine what they’re offering [for the solar development],” he says. “When this come along, that was one way of putting a bit of a buffer in there, without the cost of diversifying into something else.\\n“It was clean, green, and no trouble to go back to any other agriculture afterwards if it doesn’t work.\\n“You just can’t get sentimental about these things.”\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

But it also has a homeless crisis and an affordable housing problem.\\nTo help alleviate both, the Seattle City Council is weighing a proposal to impose a new tax on big businesses.\\nThe proposed tax amounts to 26 cents per working hour per employee in Seattle. That works out to roughly $540 a year for every full-time employee.\\nOnly businesses that generate at least $20 million of annual revenue in Seattle itself would be subject to the tax.\\nThe legislation would affect less than 3% of employers in the city, or about 585 businesses, according to Councilmember M. Lorena Gonzalez, a co-sponsor of the legislation.\\nRelated: Good luck buying a home in Seattle\\nLast fall, the council rejected a similar \"head\" tax proposal that would have raised less money but would have affected more companies.\\nThe proposed tax is expected to raise $75 million a year, three quarters of which would be used to build roughly 1,800 affordable housing units. The other quarter would be spent on emergency and shelter services for the homeless.\\nBy 2021, the per-head tax would convert to a 0.7% payroll tax and still raise $75 million, according to materials from the Council.\\nAmazon could pay $20 million or more a year\\nThe company that likely would owe the most under such a tax is Amazon, Seattle\\'s largest private sector employer. It employs more than 45,000 people in the city. If the proposed tax goes into effect, Amazon could be subject to a head tax north of $20 million a year.\\nAmazon, which declined to comment on the proposal, notes that it already contributes economically in many ways to Seattle. For example, it will provide a permanent location for a shelter in one of its new office buildings by 2020. It would be run by the nonprofit Mary\\'s Place, which already had temporary use of two vacant Amazon buildings to shelter the homeless since 2016.\\nStarbucks did not respond to a request for comment.\\nRelated: Typical Amazon employee makes less than you think\\nProsperous big businesses can in turn generate a lot of economic activity and revenue for their host city. And they may donate goods, services or money to critical social causes.\\nBut the co-sponsors of the bill note that a major cause of homelessness is the higher cost of housing that results when more workers move to a city for jobs that pay more than long-time residents have been earning. And the demand to build affordable housing doesn\\'t keep pace.\\n\"A progressive tax on businesses most benefiting from this growth is our best option because we already rely heavily upon regressive property and sales taxes that hit everyone equally,\" Councilmember Lisa Herbold said in a statement.\\nProperty and sales taxes are the city\\'s main source of revenue since Seattle does not have an income tax. Businesses there also pay a business and occupancy tax.\\nCritics of the Council proposal, however, say it\\'s a tax on jobs that could curb growth.\\nWhile a head tax isn\\'t unheard of, \"they are rare, and for good reason: most cities recognize that it\\'s not in the best interest to penalize employment,\" said Jared Wolczak, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation.\\nCertainly a tax that is seen as too onerous could influence a company\\'s behavior, noted Tax Policy Center researcher Richard Auxier. But it\\'s also true that a company locates itself in a place for more reasons than taxes, Auxier added. For instance, a business has a better chance of prospering in a socially stable city with good infrastructure, good schools and an educated workforce.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

None of these stories is legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked these out. Here are the real facts:\\n———\\nNOT REAL: American Restaurant Granted Permission to Sell Dog Meat!\\nTHE FACTS: A long-circulated false article about a California restaurant putting canine flesh on its menu offers this new twist: the sales are going forward as a court considers whether selling dishes of dog is protected in the U.S. as part of freedom of religion. But the Los Angeles County public health department says there\\'s no such restaurant there called Puchow de Manila Eatery and Fine Dining, and they noted it\\'s illegal in the state to sell dog meat for human consumption. The most recent version of the story, which has circulated since at least 2014, alleges an unnamed \"Filipino group\" asked an unspecified Supreme Court to lift the ban because it violated members\\' religious rights. The article on the grandemeli site said that in the meantime, the restaurant had \"provisional permission\" to serve the meat. The site couldn\\'t be reached for comment, as it published no contact information and registered the page through a third-party service.\\n———\\nNOT REAL: The U.S. District Attorney Has Announced That He Will Be Pursuing Charges of Treason Against the Former President Barack Obama\\nTHE FACTS: A website is recirculating an inaccurate story claiming an FBI official announced he\\'s investigating former President Barack Obama for treason. The latest version of the story appeared on a site called webviners. It alleged FBI general counsel Dana Boente will pursue such charges, but Boente never made such an announcement. Also, the piece incorrectly identified him as \"the U.S. District Attorney.\" The article also erred in claiming Obama demoted Boente at some unspecified time during his administration, removing him from a Justice Department position that was second in line behind the attorney general, and that President Donald Trump reversed that action. Obama nominated Boente in 2015 to lead federal prosecutions in Virginia\\'s eastern district, and Boente remained in that job through the rest of Obama\\'s term. After Trump took office in January 2017, the new president brought Boente to the Justice Department in Washington, where he has served in several senior roles. He officially left the prosecutor\\'s job in Virginia in October. The webviners site administrators could not be reached for comment.\\n———\\nNOT REAL: Million Pounds Of Rat Meat Being Sold As Chicken Wings In U.S.\\nTHE FACTS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration hasn\\'t issued a warning to consumers about 1 million pounds of rat meat being sold as boneless chicken wings and officials didn\\'t seize any such meat from China at the Port of San Francisco. Such claims have circulated on social media for more than a year. The latest version appeared on the Gun Society site. In an email this week, FDA spokesman Peter Cassell said the story isn\\'t true. While the tale has been published in the past as satire, the Gun Society site didn\\'t present it that way and did not offer contact information for a response.\\n———\\nThis is part of The Associated Press\\' ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\\n———\\nFind all AP Fact Checks here: https://www.apnews.com/tag/APFactCheck\\n———\\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

And in the joint agreement, it is Trump rather than the U.S. which is the party guaranteeing North Korea’s regime safety. This is diplomacy for the kindergarten.”\\nChosun‘s editorial called the results of the meeting “the worst outcome for South Korea” and applauded Kim Jong-un’s “incredible achievement” of getting a U.S. president to meet with him without yielding any “major concessions.”\\n“A closer look at the joint agreement shows it was Kim who ended up taking home the prize. It is simply unbelievable that Trump flew all the way to Singapore to end up with the short end of the stick,” an outraged Chosun concludes.\\nIn addition to its own voice, Chosun magnified that of skeptics who felt that the language in the Trump-Kim declaration was too soft to ensure that North Korea, which has serially broken international agreements, would adhere to it. Chosun has consistently throughout 2018 championed the voices of North Korean refugees and defectors who have demanded that world leaders keep the horrific human rights abuses of the Kim regime front and center in negotiations.\\nSeveral professors told Chosun Ilbo they believe the deal worsens the North Korean problem.\\n“With the latest agreement, we can kiss goodbye to the prospect of North Korean denuclearization,” Nam Sung-wook at Korea University told the newspaper. Park Won-gon of Handong Global University called the meeting the “scam of the century.”\\nThe voices condemning the meeting are largely minority voices in South Korea, a fact punctuated Wednesday by regional elections that saw the ruling leftist Democratic Party sweep so definitively that Hong and other minority party leaders are expected to resign. Public sentiment about engaging Kim Jong-un has swung dramatically throughout 2018, first dropping significantly in January following the presence of a North Korean delegation at the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, then picking up after Moon Jae-in met Kim personally. By late May, 78 percent of South Korean respondents told the Korea Research Center that they trusted Kim Jong-un to make a deal on denuclearization.\\nThe deal that Kim and Trump agreed to in Singapore Tuesday means the end of “war games” between South Korea and the United States, which often simulate the invasion of North Korea. President Trump called the exercises “provocative” and told reporters they would end, a promise he made following his meeting with Kim. South Korean government officials tentatively said Tuesday that “we need to figure out President Trump’s accurate meaning and intention of this comment.”\\nOn Wednesday, the South Korean presidential office issued a more concrete statement, saying, “We believe there is a need to consider various ways to further promote dialogue as long as serious discussions are being held between the United States and North Korea for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and establishment of peace.”\\nIn addition to a promise to work towards “complete” denuclearization, Kim promised in the joint declaration with Trump that he would repatriate the remains of Americans killed during the Korean War.\\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

That agreement outlined provisions for a cease-fire and other measures to resolve the conflict.\\nThe war, which erupted after the Russian annexation of Crimea, continues to impact U.S. relations with Russia and prompt many Western leaders to question Russian President Vladimir Putin\\'s wider intentions in Eastern Europe.\\nBBC correspondent Jonah Fisher describes the situation in Ukraine as \"a simmering conflict\" with no end in sight, characterized by frequent cross-border shelling.\\n\"The front line between the Ukrainian government forces and the Russian-backed rebel forces really hasn\\'t moved substantially over the last few years,\" he tells Here & Now\\'s Meghna Chakrabarti. \"It\\'s still a conflict which is being fought on the ground, but it\\'s not a conflict really that either side seems to think it can win.\"\\nThe USS Navy destroyer Carney arrived in Ukrainian waters this week as part of American efforts to support the Ukrainian government. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, while the U.S. and Europe have not provided significant military support to Ukraine, the ongoing conflict has damaged the prospects of collaborating with Russia on terrorism, arms control and the Syrian conflict.\\nIn December, the Trump administration announced that it would start sending lethal weapons to Ukraine to support their forces fighting in the eastern part of the country, which sparked criticism from Russia, Fisher says.\\n\"It\\'s pretty rich really coming from the Russians considering it\\'s almost accepted by almost everyone that the Russians are ... providing the support and indeed much of the manpower to the rebels in the eastern part of Ukraine,\" he says. \"On the ground, it\\'s not going to really shift the balance of power, but the Ukrainians are certainly pleased that the Americans have sort of increased their commitment to them.\"\\nThe Trump administration has sent mixed messages on Russia\\'s role in Ukraine, but in December, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was clear about the U.S. commitment to Ukraine.\\n\"Russia\\'s taking sovereign territory of Ukraine is something that we will never accept,\" Tillerson said at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [OSCE] summit in Vienna. \"And we appreciate the strong solidarity of European partners in standing up on behalf of Ukraine to restore their sovereign territory to them.\"\\nRussian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has blamed Ukraine for the stalemate in efforts to reach a peace agreement.\\n\"The whole responsibility lies with Ukrainian authorities,\" he said in his speech at the OSCE.\\nThe United Nations Human Rights Council estimates more than 1.6 million people have been internally displaced by the conflict, and for the nearly 3 million that remain living near the front lines, the humanitarian crisis is increasingly dire.\\nAlexander Hug, deputy chief monitor in Ukraine for OSCE, told NPR last August that those caught in the crossfire are struggling to survive with little power, heat or running water.\\n\"They are not in tanks and in armored vehicles,\" he said. \"They are in their houses, in their beds. They are on the streets and in their gardens and they are fully exposed to these risks, and that has to be acknowledged. It is for them that this should come to an end.\"\\nFisher adds that some European countries also want an end to the fighting, so economic sanctions against Russia can be lifted.\\n\"But so far there\\'s really been no movement in particular from the rebel side or the Russian side towards actually implementing any of those agreements,\" he says. \"There appears at the moment no real road map out of this conflict.\"\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 declined 1.3% apiece.\\nTrump\\'s controversial tariff announcement caught investors off guard and immediately raised concerns about retaliation from China or other major U.S. trading partners.\\n\"This is the first shot across the bow over a trade war,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR. \"And nobody wins a trade war.\"\\nTrump said his administration would impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum. It was not immediately clear whether Trump would exempt some countries from the tariffs, as his national security advisers have urged him to do to avoid hurting U.S. allies.\\nCorporate America has warned Trump that tariffs could backfire. Last month, the Business Roundtable warned of the risk of \"foreign retaliation\" that would \"harm the U.S. economy.\"\\nInvestors will be looking to see how U.S. trading partners react to the tariffs.\\nBeyond worries about retaliation, the tariff news drove concerns about rising costs for companies that rely heavily on aluminum and steel, like auto and plane makers. Imports make up about a third of the steel American businesses use every year, and more than 90% of aluminum used here. Shares of Boeing (BA) fell 3% General Motors (GM) dipped 4%, and Ford (F) dropped 3%.\\nRelated: NY Fed chief: Tariffs risk \\'trade war\\'\\nIf the tariffs result in higher prices on steel and aluminum, companies that rely on those products may pass on some of the costs to consumers. That raises the specter of creeping inflation.\\n\"This clearly will [lead to] higher prices in the production chain, which is part of the inflation path,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\\nThe timing of the tariff news surprised Wall Street. A formal announcement was expected at some point Thursday, but then it was called off. Later, Trump mentioned his tariff plans in a hastily arranged listening session with steel and aluminum executives. And he didn\\'t provide crucial details, such as whether certain countries will be exempted.\\nConcerns about trade come at an already shaky time on Wall Street. The S&P 500 and Dow fell about 4% in February, their worst month in two years. Fears about inflation and soaring bond yields caused a surge in volatility, including two 1,000-point plunges for the Dow.\\nThe market had come back as investors focused on the strong economy and booming corporate profits. But stocks fell sharply again on Tuesday and Wednesday, putting the Dow back in negative territory for the year.\\nTurbulence has picked up as well. The VIX (VIX) volatility index spiked 15% on Thursday. Selling pressure will climb as volatility increases, Krosby said.\\nAt least two corners of the stock market cheered Trump\\'s tariff announcement. U.S. Steel (X) and AK Steel (AKS)soared 6% and 10%, respectively.\\nCentury Aluminum (CENX) also spiked 7%. Another major aluminum maker, Alcoa (AA), gained 1%.\\nTrump\\'s tariff moves could force investors to confront another trade issue: NAFTA. Trump has repeatedly threatened to tear up this major trade deal with Canada and Mexico. Talks to renegotiate NAFTA, a major piece of the U.S. economy, have so far failed to produce a solution.\\n\"It sets off the protectionist fears that had been lying dormant,\" said Hogan.\\n— CNN\\'s Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Trump vs. Trump: It\\'s been 16 months since the election, but Wall Street is still trying to figure out which President Trump it will get.\\nWill it be pro-business Trump? His big corporate tax cuts and deregulation agenda fueled the stock market boom.\\nOr populist Trump? He demonized Goldman Sachs (GS) and hedge funds on the campaign trail and attacked American icons like Ford (F) on Twitter.\\nMore recently, there\\'s been protectionist Trump, whose love of tariffs and tirades against trade deals have raised the specter of an unwinnable trade war.\\nThe pro-business crowd has been sounding the alarm about Trump the trade hawk since the White House proposed steep tariffs on aluminum and steel imports. They are set to go into effect in two weeks.\\nThe Business Roundtable, a powerful business lobby, called the tariffs a \"major unforced error\" by Trump that will put \"tens of thousands of American jobs at risk.\"\\nThe Wall Street Journal\\'s editorial page went a step further, saying Trump\\'s \"protectionist eruption\" is a \"dangerous moment\" for his presidency. The risk, the paper said, is that he \"veers into the Herbert Hoover ditch.\"\\nRelated: Tariffs, Trump and trade war: What it all means\\nWall Street seems to be betting that pro-business Trump will win, or at least that his tax cuts will provide a cushion against trade turbulence.\\nThat bet may be based in part on Trump\\'s own obsession with the performance of the stock market. Surely he wouldn\\'t do anything to risk that, right?\\nStocks climbed on Thursday after Trump softened his tariff stance by offering indefinite exemptions for Mexico and Canada. Trade fears were firmly in the rearview mirror by Friday as the Dow surged after a \"Goldilocks\" jobs report revealed strong employment gains coupled with modest wage increases.\\nBut the risk of trade trouble is hardly over. Much will depend on how trading partners, especially the European Union, respond if they don\\'t get exemptions of their own.\\nS&P Global Ratings warned in a report on Friday that Trump\\'s tariffs raise the risk of a \"retaliatory spiral.\" While a \"full-scale trade war\" isn\\'t expected, the report said, \"such an outcome is not assured.\"\\nAnd don\\'t forget: Trump has signaled a bigger trade crackdown more squarely aimed at China is coming.\\nChris Krueger of Cowen Washington Research Group lamented in a recent report that \"predicting what is going to happen on trade policy is impossible.\"\\nThe path for a more muscular trade agenda has been cleared by the resignation of Gary Cohn, Trump\\'s top economic adviser and a staunch defender of free trade.\\nCohn\\'s eventual replacement could offer clues to Trump\\'s next steps. Will he tap a defender of free trade like Larry Kudlow or even a Cohn-like deputy and Wall Street veteran, such as Shahira Knight?\\nOr will he go the other way and select a trade hawk like Peter Navarro?\\nIf it\\'s Navarro, Wall Street may be forced to prepare for protectionist Trump.\\n2. Inflation watch: On Tuesday, the Labor Department plans to release the Consumer Price Index for February. Wall Street will pay close attention to the inflation indicator.\\nIn January, inflation rose faster than economists expected. That\\'s bad news for investors, who fear that inflation could prompt the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly — and steeply — than it had planned. The Dow dipped slightly in early morning trading when the inflation figure was reported last month.\\nThe market also reacted wildly following January\\'s jobs report, which revealed that wages grew at the fastest pace in eight years.\\nInflation fears have receded in recent weeks, especially after the February jobs report showed strong employment gains but a slowdown in wage growth. The Dow surged 441 points on the news.\\nRelated: Dow surges 441 points on strong jobs report\\n3. Consumer snapshot: The Commerce Department on Wednesday will release February\\'s retail sales.

I could never thank my attorneys enough for fighting endlessly to prove my innocence and bring me home.”\\nAccording to Overton’s attorney, Cynthia Orr, the Texas comptroller told Overton on Tuesday that she would receive a check for $573,333.33 as compensation her for her wrongful incarceration. She is also qualified to receive insurance and education benefits. Beginning next year, she will also receive an annuity.\\n“I am over the moon that Hannah has been granted compensation by Texas for her wrongful imprisonment,” Orr told ABC News. “She and her family do so much good with nothing. This small benefit will allow her and her sweet family to continue to share their goodness with all of us with some degree of comfort. It is a small thing for one who has suffered so greatly.\"\\nHannah Overton, who has long maintained her innocence, spent seven years in prison for the young child’s death. The salt poisoning case earned international attention because many believed she was wrongfully convicted and her story was featured in the 2017 documentary, “Until Proven Innocent.” ABC News has followed Overton\\'s and her husband\\'s story since her original 2007 trial.\\nKeith Hissong\\nIn May 2017, Nueces County District Attorney Mark Gonzalez officially declared Overton innocent in the death of 4-year-old Andrew Burd, the child Overton and her husband, Larry Overton, were in the process of adopting before he died more than 10 years ago. That official statement granted her access to state funds that are provided to the wrongfully convicted and also prevented her from being tried for the crime again.\\nOverton was convicted of capital murder after being accused of force-feeding Burd enough sodium to kill him. The prosecution portrayed her as a mother who had lost control and tried to punish the young boy by giving him seasoning mixed in water. At the time, Overton had four children and was pregnant with a fifth, and had no prior trouble with the law.\\nTodd Yates/Corpus Christi Caller-Times/AP\\nThe defense presented the jury with a medical mystery. They speculated Andrew might have had pica, an eating disorder characterized by an obsessive appetite and that Andrew accidentally poisoned himself by consuming a fatal amount of sodium.\\nLarry Overton was also charged with murder, but after his wife\\'s conviction, he was offered a plea deal and was given probation. After he completed his probation, the charges were dismissed.\\nOverton was released on bond in December 2014 after a Texas appellate court overturned her conviction and life sentence. But former Nueces County District Attorney Mark Skurka charged Overton a second time for murder after her release.\\nKeith Hissong\\nThose charges were not considered double jeopardy because Overton’s conviction was overturned by the higher court on the basis of ineffective counsel, which granted her a new trial. Overton\\'s original trial attorneys admitted at an appeals hearing that they had made errors.\\nSkurka ended up dropping the new case against her in 2015 but Overton remained in legal limbo until Gonzalez officially declared her innocence last year, thus closing a significant chapter on this decade-long case.\\n\"After further review of all the evidence and meeting with her defense attorneys and everyone involved, my office decided that we\\'re going to dismiss the case and include language in there that would actually indicate that she\\'s not guilty of the charge that we charged her with, or the previous administration,\" Gonzalez said at the time.\\nKeith Hissong\\nThe Overtons live in East Texas and told ABC News they have housed and supported prisoners after their release through their non-profit organization, Syndeo Ministries.\\n“I also could never begin to thank those who supported us, prayed and prayed for us, and walked with us along the entire way,” Overton said.\\nShana Druckerman contributed to this report\\n\\n### Response:\\n######\\n1.

Rick Wilking/Reuters\\nPro-Trump pundits Diamond and Silk faced questions about their relationship to the Trump campaign at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday, and their answers led to suggestions they had lied under oath.\\nThe duo may not have been forthcoming in their answers—and they may have yelled a lot— but there looks to be more nuance to the situation than it initially appeared.\\nThe hearing, titled “Filtering Practices of Social Media Platforms,” was called to discuss accusations that Facebook and other social media platforms suppress conservative content. Diamond and Silk’s Facebook page had briefly been labeled “unsafe to the community,” which many Republicans took as proof of censorship despite the company saying it was simply a mistake. That made the duo a popular subject during Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony earlier this month and got them invited to testify on Thursday.\\nDuring the hearing, Texas congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee asked whether Diamond and Silk had ever received money from the Trump campaign.\\nDiamond, whose real name is Lynnette Hardaway, said five times under oath that she had not.\\nLater, New York Congressman Hakeem Jeffries pointed to FEC records that showed the campaign had paid them $1,274.94 for “field consulting.” He reminded them that they would be committing perjury if they lied under oath.\\nSilk, whose real name is Rochelle Richardson, responded, “We’re familiar with that particular lie. We could see that you do look at fake news.”\\nShe then went on to claim that the payment was actually a reimbursement for plane tickets they purchased to fly to a Women for Trump event in Ohio and suggested that the campaign may have made a mistake in their FEC filings.\\nTrump campaign treasurer Bradley Crate sent Slate a statement that supported their version of events:\\nThe issue regarding Diamond and Silk is merely one of semantics, resulting from a reasonable misunderstanding of the Campaign’s reporting obligations. The Campaign’s payment to Diamond and Silk for field consulting was based on an invoice they submitted reflecting their costs for air travel to a Campaign event. The invoice was not supported by accompanying receipts, so as a technical matter, could not be reported as a reimbursement even though its purpose was to make them whole for their out-of-pocket costs.\\nIt’s unclear whether other parts of their testimony were accurate, such as their claims that YouTube had demonetized their videos or that Facebook had intentionally censored them for being conservative, but the discrepancy around payment could reasonably have been caused by the nuances of campaign finance laws.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

He has been urged to challenge Nelson, Florida’s only statewide-elected Democrat, by Donald Trump. Earlier this year, Scott’s closeness to the president yielded for his state an exemption from plans to expand offshore drilling.\\nIn formally announcing his campaign on Monday, Scott was expected to criticize “career politicians” and call for term limits for members of Congress.\\n“I admit that Washington is horribly dysfunctional,” Scott said, according to scripted remarks made available ahead of the announcement in Orlando.\\n“Washington is full of old thinking. Washington is tired. And the truth is, both political parties share some of the blame. They’ve tried a lot of things – it just didn’t work.

He also changed his hardline positions on immigration.\\nDemocrats have been anticipating Scott’s move and have ramped up criticism, noting that he was forced out as chief executive of Columbia/HCA amid a federal fraud investigation. Although Scott was never charged with any wrongdoing, the healthcare conglomerate paid a then record $1.7bn fine for Medicare fraud.\\nDemocrats also plan to fault Scott over his record while governor, including his push for deep budget cuts to education and his back-and-forth position on whether to expand Medicaid.\\n“Floridians will have the benefit of a clear-eyed view of a truly dismal record,” said Dan Gelber, a former state senator who is now mayor of Miami Beach. “Floridians won’t forget the damage Rick Scott’s self-serving politics have done these last seven years, no matter how he tries to change his spots and obscure his record.”\\nBefore the killings of 17 people at a Florida high school in February, Scott had an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association. He then signed a new law raising the age limit to purchase rifles to 21 and creating a process enabling law-enforcement officers to seize guns from someone who is considered a danger.\\nScott has contended that Nelson has “done nothing” on high-profile issues such as gun violence.

They spotted oil and gas leaks. They inspected damaged cell towers that had left thousands unable to call for help. \"Drones became a literal lifeline,\" former Federal Aviation Administration chief Michael Huerta told the agency\\'s drone advisory committee in November.\\nThe drones used needed a special exemption from a set of FAA rules, known as Part 107, that normally require small drones to fly below 400 feet, stay within the operator\\'s visual line of sight and avoid populated areas.\\nThese regulations make it hard for commercial drones to operate in the United States. But last October the Department of Transportation took a big step: It invited state and local governments to partner with universities and companies on tests to speed the integration of drones into the national airspace. The FAA is reviewing 149 proposals and plans to choose five to 10 by mid-May.\\nThe proposals cover a wide range of applications. Many of them are health-related. \"I am confident that one-half or more of all the applicants have put some element of medical support in their proposal,\" says John Walker, a Lancaster, Penn.-based aerospace consultant who spent 32 years at the FAA before co-founding the Padina Group, Inc in 2006.\\nWalker believes early public acceptance of drone delivery networks in urban areas will revolve around hospitals. And once drones can safely and reliably carry blood and medical supplies, that will pave the way to other kinds of drone deliveries. \"That linear network where drones can operate between hospitals ... would also have Amazon and anyone else that could meet the requirements to operate,\" Walker says.\\nSeveral companies have approached governments in developing countries about performing medical deliveries in areas with great need, poor roads and less crowded skies.\\nIn late 2016 Zipline, a San Francisco Bay Area-based robotics startup, set up distribution centers in Rwanda, where its drones had made more than 1400 flights carrying on-demand blood and emergency supplies over 62,000 miles as of last fall. This year the company will expand its medical delivery operations by launching a second base in Rwanda and new service in a larger neighboring country, Tanzania.\\nLast October Swiss Post launched a medical transport network in Lugano, Switzerland, using drones made by another Bay Area company, Matternet. So far the drones have made 350 deliveries, about 5 to 15 per day. Other groups have also brought aircraft abroad to attempt health-related deliveries, but those demo flights have not become sustained operations.\\nSuch efforts face tougher hurdles here in the U.S. where regulations focus on safely integrating drones into already congested national airspace. \"We haven\\'t seen [the FAA] be interested in a one-off approach,\" says Susan Roberts, co-founder of AiRXOS, a General Electric subsidiary focused on drone infrastructure technologies. \"It doesn\\'t do anybody any good for a delivery company to be able to fly from two specific points if they can\\'t then scale that over and over again.\"\\nBeyond blood and medical supply deliveries, drones could transform another key component of healthcare — lab tests. Timely test results help doctors diagnose infections and reduce guesswork in prescribing medications. Some of those decisions have life-or-death implications. For example, newborn babies turn yellow from jaundice as their bodies make bilirubin, a byproduct formed during normal breakdown of red blood cells. But \"very high bilirubin can be toxic to babies,\" says Dr. Geoff Baird, a clinical pathologist at the University of Washington in Seattle.\\nOf the millions of blood samples, urine specimens and swabs his team processes each year, most reach central lab facilities by car. \"We have cars going seven days a week, many times a day, up and down the state of Washington on freeways, across the passes, in the mountains,\" Baird says. The university also does testing for out-of-state hospitals and several clinics in rural communities on the San Juan Islands off the northwest coast of Washington. Getting lab samples from the islands down to Seattle hospitals for testing requires multiple stops by car, plane and ferry — a journey of about 100 miles that often takes more than 24 hours, even longer on weekends.\\nBut samples carried over the Puget Sound on a drone from the San Juan Islands could reach the main lab in Seattle in 90 minutes, Baird says. That\\'s why the university was eager to put in a bid for the FAA program.\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Johns Hopkins School of Medicine\\nThe proposed medical deliveries are part of a larger application submitted by Washington\\'s Department of Transportation, which includes other companies such as Amazon and T-Mobile. If selected, Baird says the San Juan efforts will use drones developed at Tuscon, Ariz.-based Latitude Engineering. Latitude makes the military-grade aircraft that Johns Hopkins researchers used to set a distance record carrying refrigerated blood samples ~160 miles in a 3-hour flight across the desert.\\nNorth Carolina\\'s Department of Transportation also applied to the FAA program wanting to use drones for medical deliveries. Zipline and Matternet are on that application as well as several other undisclosed proposals. Matternet is also partnering with the city of Palo Alto on a proposal to shuttle blood to Stanford hospitals. Flirtey, a drone manufacturer in Reno, Nev., is focusing on using its aircraft for last-mile delivery of defibrillators — devices the company thinks could save hundreds of thousands of lives in America each year, by increasing the chance of survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\\nUltimately, though, what makes or breaks a proposal isn\\'t likely the whiz-bang drones but rather the underlying infrastructure that ensures they can fly safely alongside commercial jets, helicopters, balloons and everything else in the sky.\\nToward that end, at a drone symposium held earlier this week in Baltimore, the FAA stressed its interest in \"sense and avoid\" technologies to prevent drone crashes, and systems that allow drones to be identified and tracked remotely. GE\\'s projects cover both areas. \"No one company is going to solve everything. We\\'re taking a holistic approach,\" Roberts says. \"We need to help the medical deliveries, we need to help the inspectors, we need to help people who are just taking pictures of houses.\"\\nThe United Nations Children\\'s Fund is working to foster this all-inclusive spirit at the global level. Last summer, UNICEF worked with local governments in the African country of Malawi to launch a drone corridor for companies, universities and nonprofits to fly test missions there.\\nMore recently, UNICEF invited groups to transport vaccines in Vanuatu, the South Pacific nation made up of roughly 80 islands east of Australia. The drone corridors run on a barter system, says Chris Fabian, who leads UNICEF\\'s venture capital arm. \"If you come and use our time, create something that\\'s open-source and useful for everyone else.\"\\nEsther Landhuis is a freelance science journalist in the San Francisco Bay Area.

But many Iranians understand that their country has resources their families never see.\\nTaking to the streets is a high-risk activity in Iran. So it is all the more notable that for the first time people are demonstrating without any purchase on the country’s political establishment. On the contrary: Even reformist politicians have chastised these protesters and suggested they are serving foreign masters.\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

By contrast, in 1999 and 2009 popular protests were largely orchestrated through the reformist faction, an affiliation that provided the demonstrators with leadership, a civil rights agenda that didn’t overflow the bounds of the Constitution, and tactical limits that protesters could breach only at their risk.\\nThis current round of protests, by all accounts, are bound by none of these constraints. They reportedly began as a hard-line assault on Mr. Rouhani but quickly acquired an independent momentum and spontaneously spread. There are no leaders to imprison or publicly humiliate, no democratic agenda to tar by association with Western values and no reason for protesters to avoid disruptive tactics or slogans that antagonize the entire ruling system. These demonstrations don’t pit elites against one another but citizens against the state. Some of the people I know who were active in the 2009 uprising profess to be frightened today — of chaos and the potential for destructive demagogy. Others call for unity in opposition.\\nIf there is one thing Americans should know by now about Iran, it is how little we know it. The Iranian regime, with its heavy-handed censorship and self-isolation, has made sure of this. So has the pitched battle over American foreign policy on Iran, which renders Iran’s domestic realities as talking points in a conversation that is really about us. There is an almost embarrassing cone of silence around today’s protesters. They live in provincial cities, Tehran reformists don’t speak for them and they are not the sorts of people connected with the domestic or international news media. Moreover, their likely demographic has been subject to casual generalizations that turn out to be wrong.\\nFor instance, the conventional wisdom inside and outside Iran has long held that the lower and working classes in Iran were clients of the state and the core hard-line constituency. Kevan Harris, a sociologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, conducted a study of welfare recipients and political affiliation that called this assumption into question. It turns out that loyalty is not so easily bought. Welfare recipients are not more politically predictable than other Iranians. And now it seems that when members of this cohort turn up on Iran’s streets, after years of being told that there is nothing wrong with an economy that can’t keep factory doors open or food on the table, their slogans are more radical than those of the presumptive middle class.\\nAyatollah Khamenei, for his part, has spent these days of rage composing anti-American tweets, warning of an American plot to dismember the country and comparing President Trump unfavorably with Ronald Reagan. This is both deflection and political savvy. Nationalism is a powerful current in Iranian life, and Mr. Trump is offering Ayatollah Khamenei the gift of a credible straw man — with alacrity, it seems. But American sound and fury mainly serve to obfuscate a domestic quandary.\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nEvery decade or so in Iran, protests erupt whose scale, intensity and persistence make global headlines. The ideological punditry flows. We read that the regime is universally hated and about to fall, and then we read that the regime is strong and the oppositionists are marginal people of no account — because, in 2009, they were predominantly middle class, or because, in 2018, they are not. Security forces crack down, the regime doesn’t fall, and dissent remains stalwart and pervasive.\\nA political scientist once told me that Iran is the exception that proves the rule: It’s the textbook example of the country that meets every precondition for democratic transition but still refuses to change.\\nIranian protests repeatedly come down to one thing: the accountability of the regime to its people. But Ayatollah Khamenei has buttered his bread on the other side. His power depends on the continued stranglehold of the security state, which he has also made the country’s economic center of gravity. So long as this is true, he can’t or won’t address the root cause of Iran’s chronic unrest.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it’s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately.”\\nBannon also gave a prescription for how such a meeting should have been set up and said he believed the Russians would likely have been introduced to Donald Trump.\\n“The chance that Don Jr did not walk these jumos up to his father’s office on the 26th floor is zero,” he said.\\nBannon also predicted to Wolff that special counsel Robert Mueller would focus his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election on money-laundering.\\nThe Trump White House was “sitting on a beach trying to stop a category five” hurricane, he said, adding that Mueller’s investigators would “crack Don Jr like an egg on national TV”.\\nIn the ensuing explosion of controversy, in which Wolff’s portrayal of White House aides’ doubts about Trump’s capacity for the job loomed large, Trump disavowed “Sloppy Steve” and argued there was no evidence of collusion between his presidential campaign and operatives tied to Russian president Vladimir Putin.\\nBannon rowed back, saying his remarks about the “treasonous” meeting had only referred to Paul Manafort, his predecessor in charge of the Trump campaign who is one of four aides indicted by Mueller. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to money-laundering charges.\\nBannon, who also told Wolff he knows no Russians, would not be a witness in any investigations, would not hire a lawyer and would not appear on national television answering questions, recently retained the same lawyer being used by former Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House general counsel Don McGahn.\\nBannon is scheduled to testify before the House panel on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the committee’s plans not authorized to discuss private committee deliberations and speaking to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\\nNeither Bannon nor his lawyer responded to requests by the AP for comment.\\nHow Bannon turned on Trump … and where the nationalist right goes next Read more\\nRussian election meddling is being investigated by Mueller, who was appointed by the justice department after Trump fired FBI director James Comey, and panels from both houses of Congress.\\nBannon, who left the White House in August 2017, has so far avoided the scrutiny of congressional investigators, who have instead focused on trying to secure interviews with top witnesses like Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.\\nBut Bannon played a critical role in the campaign, the presidential transition and the White House – all now under scrutiny from congressional investigators looking for evidence of a connection between Trump’s operations and Russia.\\nThe final result of the House investigation could be marred by partisan infighting.

Alex Wong/Getty Images\\nPresident Donald Trump was angry Sunday morning following a long, deeply reported piece in the Washington Post that claimed Chief of Staff John Kelly no longer has the power he once did inside the White House. The Post “is far more fiction than fact,” the president wrote. “Story after story is made up garbage—more like a poorly written novel than good reporting.” Trump then added flatly that the paper’s story on Kelly “isn’t true” and amounts to “just another hit job!”\\nThe Washington Post is far more fiction than fact. Story after story is made up garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting. Always quoting sources (not names), many of which don’t exist. Story on John Kelly isn’t true, just another hit job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2018\\nThis marks only the president’s latest attack against the paper, and its owner, Jeff Bezos. But the president is going to have to attack more than the Post to dismiss the story about a chief of staff in peril, considering it has become something of a theme. The clashes between Kelly and the president are “recurring and escalating,” wrote the Post. “Both his credibility and his influence have been severely diminished.”\\nAlthough Kelly was once seen as the man who could bring order to the White House, he is increasingly being left out of key decisions. And he no longer has the trust and support of some of the key members of Trump’s staff. The Post even notes he once angered First Lady Melania Trump. This is all par for the course when it comes to Trump’s White House. The Post explains:\\nKelly is the latest high-profile example of a West Wing Icarus — swept high into Trump’s orbit, only to be singed and cast low. Nearly everyone who has entered the White House has emerged battered — rendered a punchline (former press secretary Sean Spicer), a Justice Department target (former national security adviser Michael Flynn) or a diminished shell, fired by presidential tweet (former secretary of state Rex Tillerson). No one knows how many days remain for Kelly, but when he leaves — either by the president’s hand or because of his own mounting frustration — he is almost certain to limp away damaged.\\nThe Post is hardly alone in its assessment. Shortly before the paper published its story, Axios reported that Kelly threatened to quit on March 28 after a loud argument in an Oval Office meeting. “Very few people inside this White House feel secure or satisfied, given the wild, unpredictable mood and policy changes of Trump,” noted Axios’ Jonathan Swan. “Kelly months ago restored some order and sanity to the place but most of that is gone.”\\nEarlier in the week, the Associated Press also pointed out that Kelly “has receded from view, his clout diminished, his word less-trusted by staff and his guidance less tolerated by an increasingly go-it-alone president.” Trump is so frustrated by Kelly that he has even speculated about whether he could get rid of the chief of staff job entirely\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

It was “more than catastrophic”, they said.\\n“As victims of crime, we are all entitled to have an explanation when an alleged injustice has occurred. But this has been sinister, calculating, and those implicated must now face the full rigour of the criminal justice system.”\\n“These horrifying, shameful, unforgivable actions need to be disclosed in a criminal court for a jury to decide. Only then can we put our loved ones to rest.”\\nThey described the lockdown, for 11 years, of the release of findings of a 2002 inquiry, as “an abuse by powers of the almighty”. They added: “The Department of Health and its chief medical officer ignored those serious findings and continued to put patient safety at the bottom of the pile.”\\nThey described as “at best incompetent” a Hampshire police investigation, triggered by a “whistleblower” providing 1991 documentation “highlighting a culture that Dr [Jane] Barton [the GP accuses of prescribing deadly doses of painkillers to patients] had bought to the hospital”. The CPS’s failure to secure convictions was “devastating”.\\n'Disregard for human life': Gosport hospital inquiry's key findings Read more\\nEven more criticism was heaped on the inquests held into the deaths of 10 of the victims, with Barton and the nursing team afforded “top barristers” while relatives “had to fight for our legal representation coming on board at the 11th hour”.\\nDocumentation was “redacted or simply removed” to ensure jurors did not get the whole picture, the statement said. “And, whilst they [jury] did still manage to conclude that the drugs administered were inappropriate, without logic, unjustifiable and shortened life,” the relatives were angered that the jury concluded they were given for “therapeutic purposes”.\\nOf the “defective” GMC hearing, which did not strike Barton off the medical register, “that proved to us all that they are simply not fit for purpose”.\\nRelatives had been treated with contempt throughout, they said. “Every government body and or quango locked together, with no chance of objectivity, impartiality and, ultimately, the truth.” There had been “inequality of arms” to stop families achieving justice, and regulatory bodies appeared to “do whatever they want”.\\nKnowing that complaints had been made the police in 1998 would have caused “outrage” if it had been made public at the time. “None of us would have allowed out loved ones to be admitted to Gosport War Memorial hospital had we known there was an ongoing police investigation.”\\nVictims\\nElsie Devine, 88, Reeve’s grandmother, like others, died after the inappropriate administration of opioids, whose prescription was not in the best interests of the patient. She had been admitted for rehabilitation with kidney problems. Like many others she was “opioid-naive”, ie not chronically receiving opioid analgesics on a daily basis. She was given diamorphine and midazolam two days before her death in 1999. “My seven-stone grandmother, who did not have dementia and was recovering from a kidney infection, was pinned to the floor by four nurses and given enough drugs to lay out a 6ft violent man,” Reeves recently told the Sunday Times.\\nGladys Richards , 91, who had dementia and lived in a nursing home, was admitted for rehabilitation on 17 August 1998 after fracturing her hip. She died four days later. Her daughter, Gillian MacKenzie, now 84, was the first relative to raise the alarm. “When I had contacted the police and said I wanted an appointment with somebody over an allegation of unlawful killing, I was told: “There there, my dear. You’re upset,” she told the BBC. Fighting for justice had taken over her life.\\nArthur Cunningham, known as Brian, 79, was a widower with Parkinson’s disease and dementia, but was admitted for treatment for a pressure sore in September 1998. The former wartime fighter pilot died five days later. “He went in to be treated for bedsores. There’s no way he was near death,” his stepson Charles Farthing, told the Sunday Times. He was also opioid naïve. He was given a three-fold increase in pain relief three days before his death., the report said. The inquiry stated the hospital notes recorded relatives were anxious about the treatment.\\nRobert Wilson, 74, who died in 1998 was meant to be receiving rehabilitation after fracturing a shoulder, and was another the inquiry panel assessed had been administered opioids without appropriate clinical indication. He had told his family he was being drugged to death. “Help me, they’re killing me,” he begged his son Iain Wilson.\\n“I said, “No they’re not, Dad. They’re trying to do the best for you,” Wilson told the Sunday Times. “When I went in the following day, he was in a coma.” He added: “How I wish now I’d trust my instincts and got him out.”\\nStan Carby, 65, a former naval officer, died in 1999 within 24 hours of being admitted to rehabilitation following a series of mini-strokes. His daughter, Cindy Grant, said he was expected to be home in a couple of weeks and relatives had seen him at 10.30pm the night before, when he was in “good spirits”. The next morning he was in a coma. When they asked Barton if he was going to die, she said: “Well, you’ve got to just let nature takes its course,” Grant told Radio 4’s Today programme. “He wasn’t in there to die. He was in there to get better,” said Grant.\\nPeggy Coates, 76, transferred from another hospital for rehabilitation after a stroke on June 2 1999. She died on 15 July , on the day she was given the first and high dose of diamorphine, the report said. The plan had been for her to return home, it said, so it was not clear why, on her admission, Barton wrote in the hospital notes: “Please make comfortable.....I am happy for my staff to confirm death.”\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Bain acquired Toys R Us, a New Jersey-based company, in 2005 as part of a leveraged buyout. The toy retailer recently declared bankruptcy, leaving its 30,000 workers without severance.\\nBut all of the potential presidential hopefuls shared an allegiance to a laundry list of progressive issues.\\nThey argued for a strong social safety net and condemned the Trump administration in equal measure. Booker insisted “you cannot have life, liberty or pursuit of happiness without public education, without retirement security, equal justice under the law” while the California Senator Kamala Harris said government had three essential functions “public education, public safety and public health”.\\nThe room did not lack for criticisms of Trump. Bernie Sanders proclaimed that right-to-work laws were an “obscenity” while deriding the president for his demographic desire to divide up the country.\\nElizabeth Warren at one point echoed Trump’s rhetoric about “draining the swamp” when she called for “hosing out the cesspool of corruption” in Washington DC.\\n20 Dems for 2020: who might the Democrats field next time around?

The news outlet, quoting industry officials briefed on the broad outline of the plan, said the Trump administration is considering an inquiry to justify up to a 25 percent tariff on auto imports, which totaled $176 billion in 2017.

Thirteen, soon to be 14 companies, produced nearly 12 million cars and trucks in America last year. To our knowledge, no one is asking for this protection. This path leads inevitably to fewer choices and higher prices for cars and trucks in America.”\\nOn Wednesday morning, Trump indicated some action is coming on autos, although it was unclear whether he was referring to ongoing talks with China, NAFTA negotiations with Canada and Mexico or something else.\\n\"There will be big news coming soon for our great American Autoworkers. After many decades of losing your jobs to other countries, you have waited long enough!\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\\nTrump appeared to link a potential action on autos with NAFTA talks when he told reporters later on Wednesday that he felt the auto industry would “be very happy with what’s going to happen.”\\n“You\\'ll be seeing very soon what I\\'m talking about,” he said before his trip to Long Island. “NAFTA is very difficult.

But I will tell you, in the end, we win. We will win, and we\\'ll win big.”\\nTrump has already imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum after a Commerce Department investigation determined that current imports of both metals were large enough to threaten the long-term viability of both domestic industries, thereby putting U.S. national security at risk. Any new inquiry would also rely on the so-called Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, a, gives the executive branch the ability to conduct investigations to “determine the effects on the national security of imports.”\\nLast year, the U.S. imported $43 billion worth of cars from Canada, $39 billion from Japan, $30 billion from Mexico, $21 billion from Germany, $16 billion from South Korea and additional amounts from other suppliers.\\nThe White House, Commerce Department and Office of the U.S. Trade Representative did not respond to requests for comment.\\nAdam Behsudi contributed to this report.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

They argue that the NHS workforce is \"facing a crisis\" with shortages of key staff.\\nThe chief executives of the King\\'s Fund, the Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation have come together to make a joint submission to Downing Street ahead of the much-anticipated long-term plan for the NHS promised by Theresa May.\\nA policy aimed at limiting the number of skilled workers from outside the EU has been criticised by employers. An annual cap of 20,700 has led to thousands of workers, including NHS staff, being denied visas.\\nThe BBC revealed that visas for 100 Indian doctors had been refused. They had been offered short-term contracts as part of a long-running scheme in the north-west of England that provides junior doctors to more than 20 NHS trusts.\\nAnother BBC investigation showed that genetic counsellors, who identify people at risk of hereditary cancer and other serious conditions, were being turned down for visas even though there were workforce shortages.\\nImage copyright JEFF OVERS/BBC\\nThe Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, has said he will review the visa system for skilled workers, after lobbying by some cabinet ministers. He told the BBC\\'s Andrew Marr programme he was aware of the difficulties with NHS recruitment.\\n\"I see the problem with that. It is something I\\'m taking a fresh look at,\" he said.\\nThe think tanks\\' joint letter says there are \"worrying shortages of nurses, GPs and hospital doctors\". It adds: \"There is no option but to recruit more staff from overseas and to relax controls on visas.\\n\"Nurses and some other health professionals, like radiographers, are on a shortage-occupation list, which means they are given priority in allocation of visas.\\n\"But most doctors are not. And there has been a campaign by health employers to put all medical jobs on the shortage list or to take all NHS jobs temporarily out of the visa system.\"\\nThe think tank Global Future has produced analysis looking at the extent to which the NHS relies on overseas workers.\\nIt says:\\nIn the NHS in England, which employs about 1.2 million people in total, one in eight of those staff who have a known nationality - 12.5% - are from overseas\\nNHS staff in clinical roles are much more likely to come from abroad. About a quarter of doctors and 16% of nurses and health visitors are from overseas\\nUp to 45% of staff in some vital NHS specialties, including cardio-thoracic surgeons, paediatric cardiologists and neurosurgeons, are from outside the UK\\nLonger term, the lobbyists say, there needs to be a 10-year workforce strategy. And this must be given top priority and go \"hand-in-hand\" with the new funding settlement. They also call for real-terms funding increases of 4% per year. Anything less, they say, will compromise patient care and delay critical repairs to hospital buildings.\\nNHS leaders, in what looks like a planned campaign, have united behind the 4% per year figure. They fear that anything closer to 3%, which ministers may want to trumpet as a significant boost to NHS finances, won\\'t allow any improvement to current shortcomings in the system, such as rising waiting lists.\\nThey are up against the Treasury, which has wider issues to deal with in the public finances.\\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies has noted that making a chunky new investment in the NHS will have to be accommodated in the government\\'s plan to balance the books by the mid-2020s.\\n\"Unless it is able and willing to implement tax rises or further cuts to the social security budget over the rest of this Parliament, it is hard to see how a significant injection of additional cash into the NHS would be consistent with the government\\'s stated fiscal objective,\" it says.\\nThe uncertainty over the path of the economy and future borrowing requirements, adds the IFS, will make the Treasury even more cautious.\\nExpectation around the government\\'s long-term NHS funding plan has been growing by the day.\\nAnd now added to the calls for higher year-on-year spending are the demands for changes to immigration rules for health workers.

Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo\\nChildhood obesity programmes in schools are not the answer to the epidemic affecting the UK, according to researchers who say much wider local and national action is needed, including curbs on the advertising of junk food.\\nA major obesity programme introduced into more than 50 primary schools in the West Midlands has failed to have any significant effect on children’s weight. Children were given a year of extra physical activity sessions, a healthy eating programme and cookery workshops with their parents. Families were invited to activity events, including sessions run by Aston Villa football club.\\nBut at the end of 30 months, there was no difference in obesity between those children who took part and those who did not.\\nThe government’s childhood obesity plan, launched from Downing Street in January last year, placed great emphasis on increasing sport and other activity in schools. A number of school-based obesity programmes have been introduced around the country, focusing on increasing physical activity and improving children’s diet in school.\\nBut, says the team from the University of Birmingham’s Institute of Applied Health Research, the negative results from their large study published in the British Medical Journal are in line with what has been found elsewhere; schools may have a role to play but can only be part of the answer to the obesity problem.\\n“We need to look at ways that we can really engage communities in this agenda, change our local environment and look at how national policies can support diet and physical activity,” said Miranda Pallan, one of the team.\\nChildren, she said “are at the centre of lots of layers of influence”. For primary school children, parents and the wider family are key. “They function within their family. Decisions on what to eat and what they do are determined by their family.”\\nAdults, who may themselves be obese, are influenced by many different things. Local initiatives in communities can help but national policies on food and the environment are also vital.\\nThe government is tackling sugar levels in soft drinks and foods. “There are some good things in the government’s plan but we would argue that there need to be further measures and there are things like advertising restrictions that would be very good to see,” Pallan said.\\n“If anything what our research highlights is that although schools are vitally important, they can’t do it alone. We need many, many approaches. Each of those will make a marginal difference. We need to look at the whole picture of the causes and tackle each of those areas.”\\nThe institute created and introduced an ambitious programme called West Midlands ActiVe lifestyle and healthy Eating in School children, dubbed Waves. The programme included extra daily physical activity in schools, a physical activity and healthy eating programme in conjunction with local sporting heroes, regular information to parents about local physical activity opportunities, and workshops on healthy cooking for families at schools.\\nAbout 1,400 children aged six and seven took part in the trial. At the start of the trial, height and weight was recorded for each of them, along with other measurements relating to body fat, diet and physical activity levels.\\nThe researchers found no significant difference in weight status and no meaningful effect on body fat measurements, diet or physical activity levels at 15 and 30 months in children taking part in the programme, compared with those not taking part.\\nThey suggest that “nudge” interventions, such as using financial incentives to prompt healthier behaviour, merit further investigation. But they conclude that school based motivational, educational approaches “are unlikely to halt the childhood obesity epidemic.”\\nProf Melissa Wake, paediatrician and obesity expert from Victoria, Australia, says in a linked editorial that it is time to step back and take stock. The important findings of the trial “could perhaps help break the cycle of policymakers continuing with ineffective educational preventive approaches that can never hope to greatly impact on the obesity epidemic.”\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

What followed surprised some officials there: Almost no one used the law. For years, it was relegated to the back shelf of law enforcement, with only a handful of cases a year.\\nThe pace of cases began to quicken, Connecticut statistics show, after high-profile shootings occurred elsewhere, starting in 2007 with the deaths of 33 people on the campus of Virginia Tech. Advocates of red flag laws said they provided important protections, particularly as people became increasingly aware of the risks of mass shootings.\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nStill, even states with the laws have not avoided such shootings. The gunman who killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012 had access to guns, though people who knew him said he had shown troubling signs before the attack.\\n“This is a country with hundreds of millions of guns in circulation, and that fact imposes real constraints on what policy can achieve and on what kind of policy makes sense,” said Ramesh Ponnuru, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group. No one, Mr. Ponnuru added, should expect any one law to fix everything. “Realism is the right attitude,” he said.\\nMany Republicans oppose red flag laws, and the National Rifle Association has argued that a judge’s order to seize a person’s weapon may violate Second Amendment rights when no crime has been committed.\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you\\'re not a robot by clicking the box.

The removals are temporary, these officials stress, meaning that guns are returned to people no longer deemed dangerous.\\nThe laws allow weapons to be seized for a brief time — typically two or three weeks — after which a petitioner, usually a police agency, must go back to court to let a judge decide whether the gun owner’s behavior amounts to a threat to himself or others and whether the weapons should be held longer. Some states, including New York and Texas, already allow guns to be taken from mental health patients deemed dangerous, but red flag laws hinge on outward behavior — a person’s statements and actions regardless of medical diagnosis.\\n“The reason I like gun violence restraining orders as an option is that we can use them even if the person hasn’t been convicted of a crime,” said Mara W. Elliott, the San Diego city attorney. California’s measure, patterned after Connecticut’s, took effect in 2016, and late last year, Ms. Elliott assigned an assistant city attorney to pursue gun seizure cases full time, one of the first cities in the nation to take such aggressive action.\\nSo far, the office has pursued 10 cases, Ms. Elliott said, and officials there have seen circumstances involving more intimate situations than they had expected. Prompted by calls to the police, who then asked the city attorney to intervene under the new law, the authorities removed guns from Alzheimer’s patients, alcoholics and people accused of domestic abuse.\\nSince Connecticut passed its law, the state has seen 1,519 cases, about two-thirds of them since 2012. California’s far newer law resulted in 86 cases in its first year. And Washington’s superior courts have held about 65 hearings under the law since it was approved by voters in 2016.\\nRed flag laws have evolved, too. Connecticut and Indiana, which passed its law in 2005 after the murder of an Indianapolis police officer, allow only law enforcement agencies to bring petitions for temporary gun removal. Newer measures, in California, Oregon and Washington, allow family members to bring such petitions to judges as well.\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nThe effectiveness of the statutes has depended on the level of communication between the public and law enforcement agencies, according to social and health policy researchers who have studied the laws. In some places, they said, residents have been far more willing to report troubling behavior than in others. And in some communities, law enforcement agencies are more familiar with the technical intricacies of applying the red flag laws than they are in others. Even in the states that have had the laws longer, like Indiana, state officials have said that many residents and police officers are unaware of the tools they have.\\nCurtis T. Hill Jr., the Republican attorney general of Indiana, on Wednesday took the unusual step of reminding his colleagues around the state that the provision exists.\\n“Indiana’s ‘Red Flag Law’ is a common-sense measure that in no way inhibits the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens,” Mr. Hill said in a statement. “This useful provision is not as well-known, even among law enforcement, as one might expect. That’s why this week we are distributing a public safety advisory raising awareness of the law and urging police and prosecutors to make full use of it as we work together to protect all Hoosiers.”\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

However, his comments were the most positive from any U.S. official since Trump abruptly canceled the meeting last week after belligerent statements from the North.\\nThe two countries, eying the first summit between the U.S. and the North after six decades of hostility, have also been holding negotiations in Singapore and the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.\\nEarly Thursday, Trump told reporters \"we are doing very well\" with North Korea. He added there may even need to be a second or third summit meeting to reach a deal on North Korean denuclearization but still hedged, saying \"maybe we\\'ll have none.\"\\nKim Yong Chol is the highest-ranking North Korean official to visit the U.S. in 18 years, and his trip to the White House will be a highly symbolic sign of easing tensions after fears of war escalated amid North Korean nuclear and missile tests last year.\\nPompeo, the former CIA chief who has traveled to North Korea and met with Kim Jong Un twice in the past two months, said he believed the country\\'s leaders are \"contemplating a path forward where they can make a strategic shift, one that their country has not been prepared to make before.\"\\nHe tweeted from New York: \"Good progress today during our meetings\" with Kim and his team. Yet he also said at his news conference that difficult work remains including hurdles that may appear to be insurmountable as negotiations progress on the U.S. demand for North Korea\\'s complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization.\\n\"We will push forward to test the proposition that we can achieve that outcome,\" he said.\\nPompeo spoke after meeting with Kim Yong Chol for a little more than two hours at the residence of the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. The talks had been expected to be held in two sessions, one in the morning and one in the early afternoon, and had not been expected to conclude until 1:30 p.m. Instead, the two men wrapped up at 11:25 a.m.\\nPompeo said they finished everything they needed to address in the morning session. Immediately afterward, he tweeted that he had had substantive talks on the priorities for the potential summit. Pompeo was accompanied by Andrew Kim, the head of a CIA unit assigned to work on North Korea, and Mark Lambert, the head of the State Department\\'s Korea desk.\\n\"Our secretary of state is having very good meetings,\" Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews before departing on a trip to Texas. He said of the North Koreans, \"I believe they will be coming down to Washington on Friday. A letter being delivered to me from Kim Jong Un. It is very important to them.\"\\n\"It is all a process,\" he said of arranging the summit. \"Hopefully we will have a meeting on the 12th.\"\\nDespite the upbeat messaging in the United States, Kim Jong Un, in a meeting with Russia\\'s foreign minister on Thursday, complained about the U.S. trying to spread its influence in the region, a comment that may complicate the summit plans. \"As we move to adjust to the political situation in the face of U.S. hegemonism, I am willing to exchange detailed and in-depth opinions with your leadership and hope to do so moving forward,\" Kim told Sergey Lavrov.\\nNorth Korea\\'s flurry of diplomatic activity following an increase in nuclear weapons and missile tests in 2017 suggests that Kim is eager for sanctions relief to build his economy and for the international legitimacy a summit with Trump would provide. But there are lingering doubts on whether he will ever fully relinquish his nuclear arsenal, which he may see as his only guarantee of survival in a region surrounded by enemies.\\nTrump views a summit as a legacy-defining opportunity to make a nuclear deal, but he has left the world guessing since canceling the meeting last week in an open letter to Kim that complained of the North\\'s \"tremendous anger and open hostility.\" North Korea\\'s conciliatory response to that letter appears to have put the summit back on track.\\nKim Yong Chol is the most senior North Korean visitor to the United States since Vice Marshal Jo Myong Rok visited Washington in 2000 to meet President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. That was the last time the two sides, which are technically at war, attempted to arrange a leadership summit. It was an effort that ultimately failed as Clinton\\'s time in office ran out, and relations turned sour again after George W. Bush took office in early 2001 with a tough policy on the North.\\nKim Yong Chol, vice chairman of the North Korean ruling party\\'s central committee, was allowed into the United States despite being on a U.S. sanctions list, and North Korean officials are not normally allowed to travel outside the New York area.\\nThe North Korean mission at the United Nations did not respond to an email seeking comment Thursday, and phone calls were not answered.\\n———\\nLederman reported from Washington.

All of the things that have failed us, all of the systems that have failed us,” she said on “Fox News Sunday.” “I also believe we need to make it harder for people to access guns when they are not mentally stable, when they are young, when they are not in a place where they should be owning a weapon like this.”\\nSeventeen people were killed in the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland by alleged teen gunman, Nikolas Cruz, who used an AR-15 and who had a history of emotional problems, according to investigators.\\nOne of the victims’ fathers, Andrew Pollack, whose daughter, Meadow, died in the shooting, spoke about the need to make change now: “The new norm has to be our kids are safe in the school.

If it were, no president would ever have escaped eviction from office on those grounds.”\\nMr. Tobin has no shortage of harsh words for Mr. Trump and his personality. A lack of “presidential temperament,” according to Mr. Tobin, does not preclude Mr. Trump from “making decisions and often getting them right.” The 25th Amendment, he adds, “was intended to provide for a replacement when a president couldn’t serve, not to dump a man whose behavior offends the sensibilities of the educated class.” Read more »\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n_____\\nDavid Frum in The Atlantic:\\n“Trump may imagine that he’s Michael Corleone, the tough and canny rightful heir — or even Sonny Corleone, the terrifyingly violent but at least powerful heir apparent — but after today he is Fredo forever.”\\nWhatever Mr. Trump’s flaws and cognitive deficiencies may be, Mr. Frum contends, his “genius” is undeniable in one particular way: He “understands how to mobilize hatred and resentment to his own advantage and profit.” Mr. Frum suggests that instead of focusing on the president’s mental health, we turn our attention to the people and institutions that keep such a president in power — despite knowing better.

There is likely no serious way to respond until November 2018. Let’s focus on that.”\\nMs. Walsh picks up where Mr. Frum left off. She writes that her main takeaway from Mr. Wolff’s book and New York Times reporting on Mr. Trump’s interventions in the Russia inquiry is that Republicans “are circling the wagons around Trump.” She does not propose a 25th Amendment solution to the problem, however. The only way to address an unfit president whose party will not hold accountable is for Democrats to win in the midterm elections. Read more »\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Drew Angerer/Getty Images\\nA decisive majority of Senate Democrats agreed Monday to end the partial government shutdown that had entered its third day. The deal they voted through funds government operations for three weeks but also funds the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which was in danger of running out of money altogether, for six years. The Dems also say that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has agreed to bring DACA legislation to the floor for debate and voting no later than Feb. 8.\\nWas this a clever way of ending a shutdown they would have been blamed for while securing children’s health coverage and bringing DACA—a subject on which Democrats have public support when it’s polled in isolation—one step closer to a vote? Or was it an absurdly early capitulation in which the party betrayed its moral obligation to Dreamers in return for nothing more than a flimsy agreement with an unreliable partner so not to look as if they were hurting the military? Progressives online, even some with similar ideological priors who generally tend to agree with each other, are truly split.\\nTeam This Is Bad:\\nMillions of people flooded the streets of every major American city to stand up to Trump this weekend.\\nYour constituents want you to fight.

Keith Ripp, R-Lodi — who also took a job in December with Walker — three Republicans and one Democrat so far have filed signatures to get on the ballot.\\nThe Republicans are: karate school owner and Lodi Town Board member Jon Plumer; Colleen Locke-Murphy of Poynette; and self-described \"Trump conservative\" Spencer Zimmerman of Janesville, which is outside Assembly District 42 that includes most of Columbia County and covers parts of Dane, Dodge, Fond du Lac, Green Lake and Marquette counties.\\nLodi alderwoman Ann Groves Lloyd is the only Democrat in the race so far. Gene Rubenstein of Pardeeville is running as an independent.\\nOthers could still get in both races. Paperwork is due by 5 p.m. Tuesday.\\nWalker called the special elections in March after losing a lawsuit brought by a group run by Eric Holder, the attorney general under former president Barack Obama.

My people want to be free.”\\nIndonesian foreign ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir said at the time the petition was “purely a publicity stunt with no credibility”.\\nThe petition also called for the appointment of a special representative to investigate human rights abuses but was ultimately rebuffed by the UN’s decolonisation committee because West Papua was outside its mandate.\\nThere are frequent reports of mass arrests and violence by Indonesian police and military forces against separatists and their supporters, but information is difficult to verify because of restrictions on foreign media entering the territory.\\nThe leader of the Greens, Richard Di Natale, called for the Australian government to make entreaties on behalf of Awerkion and other prisoners, and to support West Papua’s calls for a UN-backed referendum.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

The example was sure to anger North Korean officials, who know that Libya’s leader, Moammar Kadafi, lost his job and his life a few years after he gave up his nuclear program.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

It was one of history’s miracles: a continent ravaged by dictatorship, genocide and war transformed itself into a model of democracy and broadly shared prosperity.\\nIndeed, by the early years of this century Europeans were in many ways better off than Americans. Unlike us, they had guaranteed health care, which went along with higher life expectancy; they had much lower rates of poverty; they were actually more likely than we were to be gainfully employed during their prime working years.\\nBut now Europe is in big trouble. So, of course, are we. In particular, while democracy is under siege on both sides of the Atlantic, the collapse of freedom, if it comes, will probably happen here first. But it’s worth taking a break from our own Trumpian nightmare to look at Europe’s woes, some but not all of which parallel ours.\\nMany of Europe’s problems come from the disastrous decision, a generation ago, to adopt a single currency. The creation of the euro led to a temporary wave of euphoria, with vast amounts of money flowing into nations like Spain and Greece; then the bubble burst. And while countries like Iceland that retained their own money were able to quickly regain competitiveness by devaluing their currencies, eurozone nations were forced into a protracted depression, with extremely high unemployment, as they struggled to get their costs down.\\n\\n### Response:\\n######\\n1.

The steak would be for the black eye he has suffered in this corruption case, now in the jury’s hands.\\nNothing in this tawdry affair works to his benefit. If Mr. Percoco, the governor’s former aide and family friend, is convicted of charges that he took gobs of bribe money — ziti, in his “Sopranos”-inflected argot — it will reflect poorly on Mr. Cuomo. But even if the verdict is not guilty, the ethical pall over Albany and its chief executive will not be dispelled.

In this regard, he is not alone.\\nHis political nemesis, Mayor Bill de Blasio, is destined to be haunted by one Harendra Singh, a restaurant owner who, it was recently reported, secretly pleaded guilty to bribing Mr. de Blasio in return for help getting favorable lease terms. No charges were brought against the mayor or his aides.

They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”\\nSince then, the U.S. president has threatened to blow up or renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has insisted Mexico will pay for a border wall between the two countries.\\nThe battle over the wall has come to dominate the U.S.-Mexico relationship, despite decades of closer trade and security ties. Trump’s fierce criticism of the U.S. neighbor has left Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto exposed at home, and former Mexican President Vicente Fox Quesada fuming:\\nHello, @realDonaldTrump, it\\'s me with a small reminder for you: We\\'re still NOT paying for your #FuckingWall. https://t.co/RDlaifwPr1 — Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) June 7, 2017\\n.@realDonaldTrump, your mouth is the foulest shithole in the world.

The president accused the Five Eyes ally of trying to send the “next Boston bombers” via a refugee swap deal, prompting Turnbull to confront him over the deal’s importance. Scheduled for an hour, the phone call reportedly lasted just 25 minutes. Trump eventually agreed to the deal.\\nSince then, the pair appear to have warmed to each other, sharing dinner and drinks on the USS Intrepid in New York City. Turnbull recently praised Trump’s rhetoric on North Korea, telling an Australian radio station it was ratcheting up pressure on the rogue nation.\\n“They cannot be rewarded for their rogue status and reckless conduct,” Turnbull said.\\n‘The Wrong Thing To Do’ In Britain\\nThe “special relationship” between the U.S. and the United Kingdom entered a new phase with Trump’s election: awkwardness. British Prime Minister Theresa May was the first foreign leader to visit Trump, a signal of the security and trade partnerships the two countries have shared since World War II.\\nBut May quickly faced pressure to change her tone, particularly after intelligence surrounding the Manchester terror attack was seemingly leaked in the U.S.\\nThe awkwardness came to a head in early January this year, when Trump retweeted several videos from the far-right Britain First party. May called the retweets “wrong,” while several other British MPs described Trump as “fascist” and “stupid.”\\nUK Prime Minister Theresa May tells Donald Trump \"retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do\" https://t.co/eXclqvhbbp pic.twitter.com/bdGUMRaWHl — BBC Breaking News (@BBCBreaking) November 30, 2017\\nAn Altered Relationship With Germany\\nUnder Trump, U.S. relations with Germany have been strained and unsettled by Trump’s controversial policy decisions, like pulling out of the Paris climate accord, and his direct criticism of German policies and its leaders.\\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said earlier this year that Berlin may not be able to rely on the U.S. in the future, and she urged Europe to take its fate into its own hands.\\n“Germany can no longer simply react to U.S. policy but must establish its own position,” Germany’s top diplomat, Sigmar Gabriel, warned policymakers at the end of last year.\\n“Even after Trump leaves the White House, relations with the U.S. will never be the same,” he added.\\nTrump has yet to appoint an ambassador to Germany.\\nMerkel asks for a handshake during White House photo op, Trump doesn\\'t respond. #Awkward\\nRead more: https://t.co/PLwqJp7kQd pic.twitter.com/IRZZvMKoSs — euronews (@euronews) March 18, 2017\\nWorrying NATO Allies\\nTrump used the 68-year-old North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a punching bag in the lead-up to the election, blasting the alliance as “obsolete” and calling out members like Germany for not paying their fair share.\\nHe continued the practice throughout the first year of his presidency. During a speech in Brussels last May, the president refused to affirm his commitment to Article 5 of the treaty — which holds that an attack against one alliance member is considered an attack against all members. (Trump later did affirm his commitment to the article.)\\nBut the future for the alliance isn’t entirely bleak. The number of U.S. personnel being deployed in Europe has gone up, Slovakia’s former ambassador to NATO, Tomas Valasek, told NPR. The real question is how Trump will respond when an ally is attacked.\\n“The honest answer is none of us quite knows,” Valasek said.\\nInsulting Haiti And African Countries\\nTrump opened 2018 by offending some of America’s key allies in Africa. After he reportedly referred to nations in Africa, as well as Haiti, as “shithole countries,” the presidents of Ghana and Senegal made their displeasure known.\\n“We will not accept such insults, even from a leader of a friendly country, no matter how powerful,” said Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo. Ghana has close ties to the United States.\\nSenegalese President Macky Sall also expressed his shock over the remarks.“I reject them and condemn vigorously.

Chad, another majority Muslim nation, was removed from the list in April.\\nAlthough several federal courts had blocked the ban nationwide, the justices allowed the policy to take full effect in December pending consideration of the merits of the case. The temporary order allowing full implementation was an ominous sign for opponents of the Trump policy, particularly since only two justices—liberals Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor— dissented.\\nThe ruling on Tuesday reverses the lower court decisions and will allow the policy to remain in place indefinitely.\\n“The Proclamation is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority. “The text says nothing about religion.“\\nCecillia Wang, deputy legal director with the American Civil Liberties Union, said the decision marked “a dreadful day” for the United States. “But we Americans will fight on to express the will of the people to uphold equality and freedom,” she tweeted.\\nPrior to the ruling, court-watchers speculated that Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court’s frequent swing vote, might struggle to reconcile the objections to anti-religious bias that he stated in his Masterpiece Cakeshop decision earlier this month with a vote for the Trump administration in the travel ban case.\\nIn Masterpiece Cakeshop, Kennedy upheld a baker\\'s religious-based refusal to sell a cake for a gay wedding on the grounds that a state civil rights commission that ruled against the baker showed “hostility” to the baker’s religious beliefs. In the travel ban case, however, Kennedy apparently set aside concerns about anti-religious bias in deference to the executive branch\\'s prerogatives concerning national security.\\nThe new high court decision marks the conclusion of a protracted legal fight over the travel ban, which critics argue stems from Trump’s discriminatory attitude toward Muslims.\\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

As administration lawyers sought to portray the policy as well within presidential authority and unrelated to Trump\\'s campaign vows, Trump often undermined those arguments.\\nLast June, he expressed regret about altering the original policy, complaining that his lawyers were pushing a \"watered down, politically correct version.\"\\nIn September, Trump again suggested that he was unsatisfied with his own policy. \"The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!\" he wrote.\\nJudges reviewing Trump\\'s policy also seized on his retweeting of anti-Muslim videos from Britain and another message broadcasting an apocryphal story about a U.S. general ordering Muslim radicals shot with bullets dipped in pigs\\' blood.\\nTrump wasted little time in office before he signed the first travel ban, which halted visas to people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for a 90-day period and suspended the refugee resettlement program for 120 days. The stated purpose of the policy was to conduct a review of security and vetting from those nations.\\nDuring the televised signing of the executive order on a Friday in late January 2017, Trump read a variation on its title, “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,” and added, “We all know what that means.”\\nWithin hours, the policy prompted confusion and distress in airports worldwide — an immediate demonstration of Trump’s disruptive approach to governance and opposition to immigration.\\nTop administration officials didn’t receive a copy of the order until two hours after the televised signing, according to an inspector general’s report released roughly a year later.\\nThe hasty rollout left U.S. Customs and Border Protection — the agency tasked with implementing the policy — scrambling to figure out which travelers should be barred entry to the U.S. and how to handle green card holders.\\nPowerful lobbying forces — including major universities, technology companies and tourism-related businesses — mobilized against the ban, and opponents won a series of legal rulings halting the policy. Trump vowed to take the issue directly to the Supreme Court, but the administration eventually opted to rescind the original policy and issue a replacement in March of that year.\\nThe second version of the travel ban dropped Iraq from the list, which spared further embarrassment for a government working closely with American troops to fight ISIS.\\nIn addition, the reworked policy stated that people with green cards and existing visas would not be subject to the 90-day travel pause. The revised order also removed a provision that may have benefited Christian refugees in majority-Muslim nations.\\nStill, federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland blocked the policy before it could take effect, ruling that the ban amounted to unconstitutional discrimination against Muslims.\\nThe Trump administration failed to convince federal appeals courts to reverse the decision, eventually elevating the matter to the Supreme Court. In June 2017, the justices issued a short-term compromise ruling that permitted Trump to implement his policy, but exempted would-be immigrants and travelers with \"bona fide\" U.S. ties.\\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration proceeded with a security review of the six nations and refugee program.\\nWhen the review of the countries concluded in September, the ban morphed into its third and current iteration, a mix of travel restrictions against citizens of eight countries. In an apparent bid to undermine claims that the policy was aimed at Muslims, Trump added to the mix limits on travelers from Venezuela and North Korea. The latest version of the ban includes provisions for people from all affected nations to apply for waivers to enter the U.S., but immigration attorneys have claimed their clients aren’t being approved.\\nEven as the legal fight over three separate travel bans played out in court, the Trump administration appeared to achieve its goal of reducing the flow of travelers from those countries.\\nThe number of non-immigrant visas issued to people from six majority-Muslim travel ban countries fell sharply over a one-year period that began in March 2017.\\nA POLITICO analysis found that over the same period, non-immigrant visas to the world’s 50 Muslim-majority countries dropped 19 percent when compared to levels in fiscal year 2016.\\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the day the Supreme Court handed down the decision.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Nielsen, announced Friday the termination of the program that has protected about 57,000 Hondurans from deportation since 1999.\\nThat designation, known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, came in response to the deadly Hurricane Mitch in 1998, which killed an estimated 10,000 people in Honduras and launched a regional humanitarian crisis.\\nTPS was created by Congress 1990 to help people from societies wracked by civil conflict or natural disasters.\\nIn a DHS statement, Nielsen said that she is delaying the effective date for termination of TPS for Hondurans for 18 months, until January 5, 2020.\\n\"...the Secretary determined that the disruption of living conditions in Honduras from Hurricane Mitch that served as the basis for its TPS designation has decreased to a degree that it should no longer be regarded as substantial. Thus, as required under the applicable statute, the current TPS designation must be terminated.\"\\nThe announcement follows similar decisions by Nielsen to end TPS for almost 200,000 Salvadorans, 50,000 Haitians and 9,000 Nepalis. Smaller numbers of Nicaraguans and Sudanese have also lost TPS under the Trump administration. All of these immigrant groups were given more than a year to leave.\\nIn light of those announcements, immigration advocates were prepared for Nielsen\\'s decision about Hondurans, which they criticized as politically driven and without regard for the actual dangerous conditions in Honduras.\\nAccording to a statement by the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc., or CLINIC, the Central American country is in the middle of a humanitarian crisis with a \"staggering\" homicide rate, lack of safe drinking for hundreds of thousands of people and chronic childhood hunger.\\n\"The administration has attempted to paint a picture that it has no choice but to terminate TPS,\" said CLINIC executive director Jeanne Atkinson.\\n\"Its action seems to suggest that all of the past Republican and Democratic administrations that extended TPS for Honduras have not properly applied the law. To the contrary, it is the Trump administration\\'s action that disregards the law and the intent of Congress in creating TPS in the first place to safeguard human lives,\" said Atkinson.\\nBut supporters of the Trump administration praised the announcement.\\n\"The hurricane that justified it in the first place was two decades ago,\" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the D.C.-based Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates immigration limits. \"At some point, temporary needs to mean temporary.\"\\nHowever, Krikorian said, he would have preferred that the Trump administration gave Hondurans only six months to arrange to leave and not eighteen months.\\n\"It [TPS] has to stop somewhere and somebody is going to be inconvenienced by this,\" he added.\\nBut Miami business owner Orlando Lopez calls the decision a \"disaster\" for him and his family. He\\'s 55, has a small trucking company with ten employees and he supports his family back in Honduras.\\nIn an interview with NPR, Lopez said Americans don\\'t understand how difficult life is in Honduras.\\n\"I\\'m afraid to return. It\\'s a matter of life or death, \" said Lopez.\\n\"Here, I have a business. I pay taxes. I have a clean record. I will have to leave it in God\\'s hands,\" he added.\\nThe government of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said that the decision to end TPS was a sovereign issue for Washington, adding that \"we deeply lament it.\"\\nAccording to the Associated Press, an ex-Honduran ambassador to the U.S. and former Central Bank president Hugo Noe said the decision will create uncertainty for many families and he predicted that most Hondurans who were covered by TPS will choose to remain in the U.S. illegally rather than return home.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

He is a former newspaper reporter and current business owner. His novel can be found at www.davidpedreira.com. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\\n(CNN) One of the first weapons in space was a triple-barreled handgun designed to kill Russian bears. Cosmonauts brought it with them into orbit in case their descent module landed in a Siberian forest.\\nThose were simpler times -- at least in terms of celestial firepower. The militarization of space is in full gear today, and it isn\\'t focused on 800-pound omnivores. People may have understandably snickered at President Donald Trump\\'s call for a US \"space force,\" but the laughter masks the fact that too few are noticing the rush by world powers to develop warfighting capabilities in orbit.\\nRhetoric often outstrips reality in geopolitics, and a lot of experts say fears of a new arms race in space are overblown, but consider these recent headlines:\\n• The Pentagon told Congress this month it is studying a combatant command for space warfare to counter recent efforts by China and Russia to militarize Earth orbit.\\n• US Air Force Chief of Staff General David L. Goldfein warned last month that American forces will find themselves fighting from space \"in a matter of years.\"\\n• China tested a direct ascent anti-satellite and antiballistic missile system in February that analysts say could destroy most US satellites.\\n• Russian President Vladimir Putin boasted this month of a hypersonic glide vehicle that can be launched into space, navigate on its own into Earth\\'s atmosphere and avoid radar and antimissile defenses.\\nAll three countries, and others including North Korea and India , are testing systems such as lasers that fry or dazzle satellites, space-borne electromagnetic pulse weapons that can knock out power grids, and satellites that maneuver in orbit and target each other.\\nOf course, this isn\\'t entirely new. Concerns about weaponizing the cosmos have been around for decades, and international laws have been written to stave them off. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which laid much of the foundation for space law, prohibits weapons of mass destruction in orbit, on the moon or on other celestial bodies. But the treaty doesn\\'t directly ban conventional weapons in space, or weapons fired from Earth into space.\\nEfforts have been made to strengthen space nonproliferation laws, but none of the major powers seem to be honest brokers in the endeavor. While Russia and China blast the United States for refusing to agree to the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space resolution in the United Nations, they\\'re also actively testing anti-satellite systems and making no secret about their research and development for space weaponry.\\nAnd the US military has been flying a secretive, unmanned mini-space shuttle called the X-37B since 2010. It stays in orbit for two years at a time. The Air Force insists it isn\\'t a potential weapons platform. The Chinese and Russians are dubious.\\nSo where does this leave us? Science fiction writers like looking at things from 50,000 feet up -- or even 50,000 miles. And the view from that height is chilling.\\nCalling for an outright ban on weaponry buzzing around low or high-Earth orbit feels like tilting at windmills at this point. There\\'s too much momentum in the wrong direction. And few are talking about the even bigger issue outside of Earth\\'s gravitational embrace: the future resource mining of the moon, the asteroid belt and other parts of the solar system.\\nIt\\'s understandable, because so far there\\'s been nothing worth fighting for in deep space. It costs thousands of dollars to put one pound of payload into orbit. Mining an asteroid for rare metals just isn\\'t cost-effective or technically achievable -- yet.\\nBut the price to launch material into space is dropping, and companies and governments are gearing up for when the tech is ready. Consider that an asteroid with the scientifically dreary name of 2011 UW158 comes within a few million miles of Earth in its eccentric orbit -- and it reportedly contains about $5.4 trillion worth of platinum.\\nAn economic market that makes the Silk Road look like a five-and-dime will eventually open up in the solar system. And when has humanity ever kept peace in the face of such a mother lode? Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk may have good intentions for space today, but what about the astro-tycoons wrestling over trillion-dollar rocks in the future?\\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\\nEven if we take the most cynical approach about the growing arms race in Earth orbit -- that it\\'s a fait accompli -- can\\'t we at least make a push for an absolute weapons ban in those regions of the solar system that haven\\'t already been compromised? Physicists, astronomers and influencers such as science fiction authors could lend their voices to such an effort. They could argue that we don\\'t have to take the sins of the Earth with us into the heavens.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Tesla has grown and evolved rapidly over the past several years, which has resulted in some duplication of roles and some job functions that, while they made sense in the past, are difficult to justify today.\\nAs part of this effort, and the need to reduce costs and become profitable, we have made the difficult decision to let go of approximately 9% of our colleagues across the company. These cuts were almost entirely made from our salaried population and no production associates were included, so this will not affect our ability to reach Model 3 production targets in the coming months.\\nGiven that Tesla has never made an annual profit in the almost 15 years since we have existed, profit is obviously not what motivates us. What drives us is our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable, clean energy, but we will never achieve that mission unless we eventually demonstrate that we can be sustainably profitable. That is a valid and fair criticism of Tesla’s history to date.\\nThis week, we are informing those whose roles are impacted by this action. We made these decisions by evaluating the criticality of each position, whether certain jobs could be done more efficiently and productively, and by assessing the specific skills and abilities of each individual in the company. As you know, we are also continuing to flatten our management structure to help us communicate better, eliminate bureaucracy and move faster.\\nIn addition to this company-wide restructuring, we’ve decided not to renew our residential sales agreement with Home Depot in order to focus our efforts on selling solar power in Tesla stores and online. The majority of Tesla employees working at Home Depot will be offered the opportunity to move over to Tesla retail locations.\\nI would like to thank everyone who is departing Tesla for their hard work over the years.

To those remaining, I would like to thank you in advance for the difficult job that remains ahead. We are a small company in one of the toughest and most competitive industries on Earth, where just staying alive, let alone growing, is a form of victory (Tesla and Ford remain the only American car companies who haven’t gone bankrupt). Yet, despite our tiny size, Tesla has already played a major role in moving the auto industry towards sustainable electric transport and moving the energy industry towards sustainable power generation and storage.

The dossier contained colorful but unverifiable information about Trump.\\nDemocrats, the FBI and the Department of Justice objected to the release of the memo. In part, Democratic lawmakers suggested that the memo was selectively edited by Republicans to push an agenda of derailing the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Intelligence officials have stressed the memo is incomplete.\\nHere is what the newly released memo contained:\\nThe dossier was key to warrant requests\\nChristopher Steele, who compiled the controversial dossier containing colorful but unverifiable claims about Trump, confirmed to former associate deputy attorney general Bruce Ohr that he “was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.”\\nFISA warrants are not easy to obtain, but the memo suggests that intelligence officials relied heavily on the dossier as well as a 2016 report from Michael Isikoff to obtain the warrants. Isikoff’s Yahoo News report, according to the memo, was “derived from information leaked by Steele himself.”\\nThe FBI and DOJ officials were able to obtain a FISA warrant to electronically target Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to Trump.\\nFormer deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe told the House Intelligence Committee in December 2017 that a surveillance warrant would not have been sought without the dossier and what it purportedly revealed, the memo stated.\\nThe dossier’s funding was not recorded in surveillance warrant requests\\nThe surveillance warrants and renewals did not mention that the dossier was paid for, at least in part, by the Democratic National Committee and the campaign for Hillary Clinton. The memo says the DOJ was aware at the time of the initial FISA application that “political actors were involved with the Steele dossier.”\\n“Neither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steele’s efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were known to senior DOJ and FBI officials,” the memo alleged.\\nInstead, according to the memo, the FISA application said Steele was working for a \"named U.S. person\" – but did not specifically include Fusion GPS, the firm behind the project, or its co-founder, Glenn Simpson. Fusion GPS was hired by law firm Perkins Coie, which represented the DNC and Clinton campaign.\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Cohen, President Trump\\'s longtime personal lawyer, steered a client to Stormy Daniels\\' then-attorney last fall, a year after the two men negotiated a secret $130,000 deal silencing the porn star about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump, Daniels\\' attorney confirmed to CNN.\\nKeith M. Davidson said in a statement provided to CNN that Cohen gave his name to entertainment executive and Trump associate Chuck LaBella, who was being written about on Twitter by actor Tom Arnold.\\nThe referral is potentially significant amid allegations of coziness between Davidson and Cohen contained in a lawsuit filed by another Davidson client, Karen McDougal, who also says she had an affair with Trump. The lawsuit claims that Davidson was part of a \"broad effort to silence and intimidate her and others.\" Davidson disputes that claim.\\nArnold accused LaBella, who worked as a producer on NBC\\'s \"The Apprentice\" and on Trump\\'s Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, of possessing damning information about the President. Arnold\\'s cryptic tweets did not provide details or evidence to back up his claims.\\n\"Chuck LaBella has all the dirt,\" Arnold tweeted in October of last year.\\n\"Chuck LaBella was there and knows all,\" a second tweet alleged.\\nA third tweet made a veiled reference to a \"Putin call\" and other matters supposedly linking Trump to Russia.\\nIn response to the tweets, Davidson wrote an email to Arnold\\'s attorney, Marty Singer, asking that the actor stop falsely implicating LaBella as a witness to any alleged misdeeds by Trump, according to a source who has read the email.\\nDavidson told CNN he was not paid for sending the correspondence and did no further work on the matter. He said he did not know whether Cohen provided LaBella with the names of other attorneys as well.\\nIn response to an inquiry from CNN, LaBella wrote:\\n\"Keith Davidson has never been hired as my counsel. I have never met him. I have never paid him. I have never signed any agreement with him.\\n\"A friend called Keith on my behalf, because of his close relationship with Tom Arnold\\'s lawyer (Marty Singer). To stop Tom Arnold from spreading these slanderous accusations and outright lies.\"\\nAsked whether Cohen was the friend who made the referral, LaBella replied:\\n\"After working for over 30 years in Hollywood, Keith has been know(n) as the fixer. Many people over the years have recommended Keith to me.\\nHe has been in my rolodex, that\\'s how I know of him.\"\\nThe New York Times and The Smoking Gun have previously reported that Cohen referred LaBella to Davidson, but did not indicate whether any of the parties involved confirmed the link.\\nDavidson\\'s confirmation of the referral to CNN follows an exclusive interview earlier this week in which he said he\\'d spoken with President\\'s lawyer on several occasions regarding two women who claim to have had sex with the married billionaire in 2006. Trump has denied the affairs.\\nDavidson said he called Cohen in the late summer of 2016 to inform him that he\\'d settled a case involving Playboy model McDougal. McDougal sold the rights to her story to American Media Inc., the parent company of the National Enquirer, for $150,000 and other perks. Davidson said he informed Cohen of the deal as \"a professional courtesy.\"\\nThe Enquirer never published the story, effectively silencing McDougal\\'s claims in the run-up to the election. She has since filed a lawsuit accusing Davidson of \"working closely with representatives for Mr. Trump while pretending to advocate on her behalf.\"\\nDavidson said Cohen had also reached out to him after Daniels appeared on \"60 Minutes\" in late March and described her alleged sexual encounter with Trump. In the interview, Daniels said her lawyer had pressured her to sign a statement falsely stating that the encounter never happened.\\n\"I don\\'t believe that the facts ... in the interview were a fair and accurate representation of my representation of her at the time,\" Davidson told CNN.\\nDavidson said Cohen advised him that he thought Daniels had violated her confidentiality agreement and encouraged Davidson to \"spill his guts\" about the true circumstances surrounding the deal.\\nDavidson said he consulted an ethics lawyer and still felt bound by attorney-client privilege, even though he was no longer working with Daniels. He denied working in concert with Cohen on either matter, but declined to discuss details of either case, citing attorney-client privilege.\\nHe told CNN that he and Cohen first intersected in 2011 when Davidson called to inform him that he was representing Daniels in a bid to have a story about her having sex with Trump removed from a gossip website called TheDirty.com. He said the matter was quickly resolved and the story was removed.\\nCohen has declined comment on Davidson\\'s characterization of their alleged conversations.\\nMichael Avenatti, Stormy Daniels\\' current attorney, said: \"As more evidence comes to light relating to his close personal relationship with Michael Cohen and his efforts to protect Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump at the expense of his clients, we grow increasingly disturbed. ...

A man wearing nothing but a coat stormed the restaurant before dawn Sunday and shot several people to death, according to police, who credited a customer with saving lives by wresting a weapon away from the gunman. | Sheila Burke/AP Photo Police: Waffle House suspect arrested\\nThe suspect in a quadruple homicide at a Nashville Waffle House was taken into custody Monday, police said.\\nAuthorities had mounted a massive manhunt for 29-year-old Travis Reinking, after the Sunday morning attacks.\\nStory Continued Below\\nAuthorities announced the arrest Monday afternoon on Twitter, but did not immediately give details.\\nMore than 100 Nashville police officers had been going door-to-door and searching wooded areas, joined by dozens of agents with the FBI, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and troopers with the Tennessee Highway Patrol.\\nPolice said he had stolen a BMW days before the attack. The car was quickly recovered, but authorities did not immediately link it to Reinking.\\nReinking, described as a white man with brown hair, opened fire with an AR-15 in the Waffle House parking lot and then stormed the restaurant shortly after 3 a.m. Sunday, police say. Four people were killed and four others were injured before a quick-thinking customer wrestled the assault weapon away, preventing more bloodshed. Reinking then disappeared, police said.\\nPolice say about 20 people were in the Waffle House at the time of the shootings. They included people of different races and ethnicities, but the four people killed were minorities_three black and one Hispanic.\\nIt\\'s not clear why Reinking opened fire on restaurant patrons, though he may have \"mental issues,\" Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief Steve Anderson said earlier. He\\'s considered armed and dangerous, because he was known to have owned a handgun authorities have not recovered.\\nMeanwhile, authorities in Illinois shared past reports suggesting multiple red flags about a disturbed young man with paranoid delusions.\\nIn May 2016, Reinking told deputies from Tazewell County, Illinois, that music superstar Taylor Swift was stalking him and hacking his phone, and that his family was also involved, according to a report released Sunday.\\nReinking agreed to go to a local hospital for an evaluation after repeatedly resisting the request, the sheriff\\'s report said.\\nAnother sheriff\\'s report said Reinking barged into a community pool in Tremont, Illinois, last June, and jumped into the water wearing a pink woman\\'s coat over his underwear. Investigators believed he had an AR-15 rifle in his car trunk, but it was never displayed. No charges were filed.\\nLast July, Reinking was arrested by the U.S. Secret Service after he crossed into a restricted area near the White House and refused to leave, saying he wanted to meet President Donald Trump. Reinking was not armed at the time, but at the FBI\\'s request, state police in Illinois revoked his state firearms card and seized four guns from him, authorities said.\\nThe AR-15 used in the shootings was among the firearms seized.\\nIn August, Reinking told police he wanted to file a report about 20 to 30 people tapping into his computer and phone and people \"barking like dogs\" outside his residence, according to a report.\\n\"There\\'s certainly evidence that there\\'s some sort of mental health issues involved,\" Tazewell County Sheriff Robert Huston said. But he said deputies returned the guns to Reinking\\'s father on the promise that he would \"keep the weapons secure and out of the possession of Travis.\"\\nReinking\\'s father \"has now acknowledged giving them back\" to his son, Aaron said.\\nPhone calls to a number listed for the father, Jeffrey Reinking, went unanswered.\\nIt is not clear why Reinking moved recently from Morton, Illinois, and if it had anything to do with being near Swift, who has a home in Nashville. Police say he worked in construction for a while.\\nPolice say Reinking drove into the Waffle House parking lot in his gold Chevy Silverado pickup early Sunday and sat there for about four minutes before opening fire outside the restaurant.\\nThe victims fatally shot in the parking have been identified as Taurean Sanderlin, 29, of Goodlettsville, and Joe Perez, 20, of Nashville.\\nSanderlin was an employee at the restaurant.\\nPerez\\'s mother posted a picture of her son on Facebook and asked for prayers, saying it was the hardest day of her life. \"Me, my husband and sons are broken right now with this loss,\" Trisha Perez said in the post. \"Our lives are shattered.\"\\nReinking then entered the restaurant and opened fire, police said.\\nOne of the fatally wounded inside was DeEbony Groves, a 21-year student at Nashville\\'s Belmont University. She was remembered as an exceptional student who made the Dean\\'s list, and a tenacious basketball player.\\n\"She was a brilliant young lady, very, very intelligent and a very hard worker,\" Gallatin High School basketball coach Kim Kendrick told The Tennessean.\\nAkilah Dasilva was also killed inside the restaurant. The 23-year-old from Antioch was a rap artist and music video producer who had such skills behind the camera that he was a favorite among many of Music City\\'s independent musicians and recording labels, The Tennessean reported.\\n\"Music is my life and I will never stop until I achieve my dreams,\" Dasilva said on his Twitter account.\\nDasilva\\'s mother told CBS News that her son was a student at Middle Tennessee State University and aspired to be a music engineer.\\nHe was at the restaurant with his girlfriend, 21-year-old Tia Waggoner, the paper reported.

Dasilva\\'s family said she underwent surgery and doctors were trying to save her leg.\\nPolice say Sharita Henderson, 24, of Antioch, was wounded and is being treated at VUMC.\\nAlso wounded was James Shaw Jr., a 29-year-old restaurant patron who burned his hand grabbing the hot muzzle of the assault weapon as he wrestled the gun away. A Nashville native who works as a wireless technician for AT&T, Shaw said he was no hero — despite being hailed as one by Nashville Mayor David Briley.\\nShaw said he pounced on the suspect out of self-preservation, after making up his mind that \"he was going to have to work to kill me.\"\\nThis article tagged under: Tennessee\\nMass Shootings\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Photograph: HANDOUT/AFP/Getty Images\\nThe daughter of a Swedish bookseller who was seized by Chinese agents while travelling with two European diplomats has said she fears her father is facing years behind bars after police claimed he was involved in “trafficking state secrets”.\\nGui Minhai, a 53-year-old Hong Kong publisher who had specialised in gossipy books about China’s political elite, was taken from a Beijing-bound train on the morning of 20 January as he attempted to reach the Swedish embassy for a medical examination.\\nSweden’s foreign minister this week attacked China’s “brutal intervention” while Germany’s ambassador to Beijing denounced what he called the unprecedented treatment of an EU citizen. “There is a widespread fear that these violations of international laws … could happen to other EU citizens in the future,” Michael Clauss warned.\\nAngela Gui, the publisher’s daughter, told the Guardian: “I just hope there will be an update soon. But I have to say that at this point I’m not very optimistic that we’ll have any sort of good news any time soon.”\\nMystery continues to surround the politically charged and increasingly surreal saga of Gui Minhai, which began back in October 2015 when he vanished from his holiday home in Thailand.\\nGui subsequently reappeared in custody in mainland China, making what supporters condemned as a forced confession to involvement in a fatal hit-and-run incident in 2003. Four other booksellers, including one British citizen, were also seized leading to criticism from politicians in the UK, including then foreign secretary Philip Hammond.\\nGui, who became a Swedish citizen in 1992, had seemed close to release last autumn when it emerged he was living under surveillance in the eastern port city of Ningbo. However, those hopes were dashed when he was apprehended for the second time. His current whereabouts are unknown.\\nThe Guardian understands that on the day Gui Minhai was taken, Sweden’s ambassador to China, Anna Lindstedt, went to China’s foreign ministry seeking answers. Swedish diplomats were referred to police in Ningbo who confirmed the bookseller was in detention and suspected of trafficking in state secrets.\\nAngela Gui said: “There is no way that he would know any state secrets that wouldn’t have anything directly to do with his case. He was in incommunicado detention for two years. So who would have told him these state secrets?”\\n“I can only guess that it might have something to do with what happened when he was taken the first time. And that whoever ordered this didn’t want this to come out,” she added.\\nChina has dismissed criticism of its treatment of Gui, who supporters say was seeking medical treatment in Beijing because of fears he was suffering from a rare neurological disease.\\n“The Swedish side should know the case is serious in nature and some Swedish people have played an irresponsible role in this,” foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, told reporters, warning further criticism could damage bilateral relations.\\nOn Thursday an editorial in the Communist party-run tabloid, the Global Times, accused Sweden and Germany of “rudely provoking China’s judicial sovereignty” and claimed both countries should be ashamed of their “imperialist” meddling.\\nAngela Gui urged more western governments to confront Beijing over her father’s plight. “It’s important to be vocal and public about this and really I would have wished that this would have happened since the very beginning when he was taken 2015. I can’t help but wonder if the international community had been more vocal back then, if we would have this situation today.”\\n“Nobody knows what is going to happen now. But if China is claiming he committed all these crimes, and if they are not backing down on that, that suggests there’s going to be a trial. And I expect that if there is indeed a trial he will probably get a very long sentence because of the nature of the crimes he is suspected of.”\\n\\n### Response:\\n######\\n1.

The president then returned to the microphone to restate his claim that \"there has been nobody tougher on Russia than President Donald Trump.\"\\n\"We had a very, very severe ... fight in Syria recently [in February] between our troops and Russian troops and that’s very sad,\" the president said. \"Many people died in that fight.\"\\n\"With the media, no matter what I did, it’s never tough enough because that’s their narrative,\" Trump lamented. \"But Russia will tell you there has been nobody tougher than Donald Trump.\"\\nThe president spoke one day after an intra-administration quarrel over sanctions erupted in public earlier this week.\\nThe dispute began Sunday, when U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told CBS News\\' \"Face the Nation\" that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would announce new sanctions directed at Russian companies associated with Syria\\'s chemical weapons program on Monday, \"if he hasn\\'t already.\"\\nThree senior administration officials told The Associated Press that the sanctions would have been announced Friday night, at the same time U.S., French, and British forces launched a missile strike on Syrian President Bashar Assad\\'s chemical weapons facilities. But the sanctions were not ready in time for Trump\\'s statement announcing military, so they were delayed.\\nThe officials said a decision was then made to announce the sanctions as an answer to Russia\\'s response to the strikes. But that plan was re-evaluated and then put on hold over the weekend as it became clear that Russia\\'s response was less robust than anticipated. The officials were not authorized to discuss private administration deliberations publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.\\nA National Security Council memorandum sent overnight Friday said the new sanctions would be announced soon, but it did not specify a date. Over the next 36 hours, officials began to delve deeper into the proposed sanctions and decided to hold off on anything imminent, but Haley was unaware, the officials said.\\nAfter she made her comments on Sunday, the White House informed the Russian embassy that there would not be more sanctions as of now, an administration source told Fox News.\\nOn Monday, a new memo went out from the NSC saying that additional sanctions were under consideration, but no decision had been made. In the face of Haley\\'s refusal to clarify on Sunday, draft language was sent to her suggesting again that she do so, the officials said.\\nHaley and her office ignored that, so the White House decided to push back, the officials added.\\nOn Tuesday, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told reporters that Haley \"got ahead of the curve\" when she said new sanctions were coming. Kudlow said additional sanctions were under consideration but have yet to be implemented. Of Haley, he said, \"There might have been some momentary confusion about that.\"\\nHaley then issued a terse statement to Fox News: \"With all due respect, I don\\'t get confused.\"\\nFox News\\' John Roberts, Serafin Gomez and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Susan Collins, who got seemingly ironclad promises in order to sign her crucial vote onto the GOP\\'s tax reform bill (a banner achievement, but the Republicans\\' only real legislative accomplishment while controlling Congress and the White House). The tax bill also repealed the individual mandate -- the Obamacare requirement that Americans have health insurance or a pay a fine or tax.\\nOne of the things Collins got in exchange for her vote , she said at the time, was the assurance of the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that he would allow a vote on her plan along with Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson to give insurance companies money to help pay for the most expensive patients. Separately, there was to be a vote on a plan by Sens. Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, and Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, to temporarily shield insurance companies from President Donald Trump\\'s unilateral decision to end Obamacare cost-sharing subsidies that helped them provide coverage to 6 million lower-income Americans.\\nThat was back in December. The promise to Collins was for a vote by the end of the year.\\nBut the day after the tax vote, it was clear there would be no vote in 2017, something Collins acknowledged in a December 20 joint statement with Alexander, author of that separate bipartisan bill.\\nThere were already indications Democrats and Republicans in the House might not be on board for the same version of the proposals. Instead, Collins and Alexander said they would introduce the stablilization bills early in 2018 and debate it around the massive \"omnibus\" spending bill lawmakers use to fund the government.\\nAnd that brings us to Thursday, nearly a quarter of the way into 2018. Republican leaders on Wednesday released the massive omnibus -- which is thousands of pages long.\\nHere are a few ways to look at this:\\nCollins was effectively rolled; McConnell made his promise to get her vote without ever intending to follow through. Events conspired against her; McConnell made the promise, but then just couldn\\'t find a way to schedule the vote. He tried. He really did, but an immigration debate, a guns debate and other things just got in the way.\\nSpecifically, bipartisan agreement that the government should not just turn off its subsidy payments has turned into a fight over abortion . Republicans in the House wanted to add language barring federal funding for abortions to plans offered with government help on the private market. Democrats want to stick with current language that allows abortion coverage in these private plans, but requires a separate payment for such coverage.\\nSo, even though Senate leaders made their promise and Trump told Collins in a phone call over the weekend he supports what\\'s in her bill, for an unrelated reason -- abortion rights -- it will now not be in the omnibus spending bill. There\\'s also a very real question over whether the Collins proposal would result in stabilizing the market, as the Portland Press-Herald in Maine made clear.\\nThe end result (and the lesson for any lawmaker) is the same, however. Collins gave away the valuable thing she had and didn\\'t get what she wanted in return.\\nShe\\'s not the only one. Democrats pledged and promised they would do something to help undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children who signed up for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program\\nWhen he created that program, President Barack Obama promised the government would look out for them. When Trump ended the program, Democrats (and a lot of Republicans) promised to do something to fix the problem.\\nBut when it became clear that public opinion as turning away from them, Democrats gave in, agreed to re-open the government in exchange for a debate later on.\\nUnlike Collins, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer got his debate on immigration. It lasted a week and yielded no legislation, despite some bipartisan proposals. There was an opportunity to add protections for Dreamers in the omnibus, too, but they were also left out.\\nAgain, the lesson here is that if you really want something in Washington, you\\'re going to have to use up everything you\\'ve got in order to get it. And you\\'re going to have to get it in hand before you give away your leverage.\\nBecause the days of grand bipartisan debates in which lawmakers hash things out on the Senate or House floor are something of a myth at the moment.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

But alcohol abuse can take its toll on not only your health, but the economy as well. Buzz60\\nLiquor by the drink in Nashville, Tenn. on October 3, 2012. (Photo: Samuel M. Simpkins, The Tennessean)\\nExcessive drinking can lead to a variety of health problems and significantly shorten a person’s life. The habit claims nearly 90,000 lives each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And those who die as the result of alcohol abuse do so 30 years prematurely, on average.\\nExcessive alcohol consumption, according to the CDC, includes binge drinking and heavy drinking. Binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks in a single occasion for women and five or more for men, and heavy drinking is defined as at least eight drinks per week for women and 15 for men.\\nNationwide, 18.0% of American adults drink an excessive amount of alcohol. However, the excessive drinking rate ranges considerably across states. In some states, just over 1 in 10 adults drink too much on a regular basis, while in others, the share is closer to 1 in 4.\\nMore: Alcohol abuse: The drunkest city in every state\\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from the CDC to identify the states reporting the highest levels of adults who binge drink or drink heavily.\\n50.

However, it is not a rarity either as 11.2% of the adult population drinks excessively. Nationwide, a much higher percentage of adults report excessive drinking, at 18.0%.\\nExcessive drinking over time can lead to a myriad serious and potentially fatal health issues, including certain cancers, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease. Despite the relatively few adults who binge drink or drink heavily, Tennessee has one of the highest premature death rates of any state. For every 100,000 state residents, 436 die before age 75, the eighth highest premature death rate among states. Perhaps the adult smoking rate of 21.9% — the seventh highest share among all states — contributes to the higher premature death rate.\\n49. West Virginia\\nAdults drinking excessively: 11.4%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 32.0% (25th lowest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 23.7% (the highest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Morgantown, WV\\nOnly 11.4% of adults binge or heavily drink in West Virginia, much less than the 18.0% of adults who binge or heavily drink nationwide. States with lower excessive drinking rates are often home to lower income populations; and West Virginia is no exception. The state’s median household income of $43,385 is well below the median household income nationwide of $57,617, and the second lowest of any state.\\nAlcohol consumption is just one of many behavioral factors that can affect health outcomes and as a result, areas with low excessive drinking rates are not necessarily the healthiest. In West Virginia, nearly 24% of adults are in fair or poor health, the largest share of any state.\\n48. Utah\\nAdults drinking excessively: 12.4%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 19.7% (the lowest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 12.9% (6th lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Salt Lake City, UT\\nIn Utah, 12.4% of adults report excessive drinking, well below the 18.0% share of adults nationwide who either binge drink or drink heavily. States with a lower share of adults drinking excessively tend to have lower rates of alcohol-related driving deaths. Only 19.7% of driving deaths in Utah involve alcohol, the lowest alcohol-related driving death rate of any state and far below nationwide rate of 30.0%.\\nLow excessive drinking rates in Utah are partially attributable to religious faith. Over half of the state’s population identify as Mormon, a religion that expressly forbids alcohol consumption.\\nMore: Economic disparity: 10 States where the middle class is being left behind\\n47.

This is a considerably lower share than the 18.0% of adults who binge or drink heavily nationwide. Although excessive drinking can lead to serious health problems, including liver cancer and cardiovascular disease, states with lower shares of adults drinking excessively are often less healthy than states reporting higher shares of excessive drinking. An estimated 21.2% of adults in Alabama are in fair or poor health, the fourth largest share of any state.\\nAlcohol consumption is only one factor that can affect health. While Alabama adults drink less, many struggle with other health issues. For example, an estimated 34.0% of adults are obese, the fifth highest share among states.\\nCLOSE Drinking wine can help with weight loss, which is great news if you need to shed a few holiday pounds.

Despite the link between excessive drinking and a myriad of health problems, states with lower drinking rates tend to report worse health outcomes than states with higher drinking rates. In Mississippi, 22.2% of adults report being in fair or poor health — the third largest share of any state. This could be a function of income, as states with lower drinking rates also tend to have lower incomes, and poorer states generally report poorer health outcomes. Mississippi has the lowest median household income of all states at $41,754 a year and the highest poverty rate at 20.8%.\\nWhile excessive drinking is never healthy, it is only one behavioral factor that can affect health. For example, lack of exercise can lead to obesity and heart problems, and in Mississippi, 31.9% of adults lead completely sedentary lives, the highest share among all states and well above the national average of 22.0%.\\n45. New Mexico\\nAdults drinking excessively: 13.8%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 32.1% (25th highest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 20.2% (8th highest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Santa Fe, NM\\nSome 13.8% of adults in New Mexico binge drink or drink heavily, a smaller share than the 18.0% of American adults who do. Despite the lower excessive drinking rate, the state reports poorer health outcomes such as an above average premature death rate and a higher share of adults reporting being in fair or poor health.\\nIn general, states that have smaller shares of adults who drink heavily are likely to have lower incomes. New Mexico is one such example with a median household income of $46,748 a year, nearly $11,000 below the national figure of $57,617 and the seventh lowest median income nationwide. New Mexico also has the third highest poverty among all states at 19.8%.\\n44. Oklahoma\\nAdults drinking excessively: 13.9%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 29.9% (19th lowest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 20.9% (6th highest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Lawton, OK\\nNearly 14% of adults in Oklahoma drink excessively — below the national average of 18%. Over time, binge or heavy drinking can lead to many health problems. However, excessive drinking is only one of many factors that can contribute to poor health. Adults in Oklahoma are much more likely to be physically inactive and smoke than the typical American. Partially as a result, despite a lower binge and heavy drinking rate, about 1 in 4 adults in the state are in fair or poor health, the sixth highest share of any state.\\nMore: Financial security: Best (and worst) states to grow old in \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\n43.

In North Carolina, that share is much lower at 15%. Drinking too much alcohol on a regular basis can lead to many health complications — both short and long term — ranging from alcohol poisoning to certain cancers. Despite the lower percentage of adults drinking to excess, 18.5% of adults in North Carolina report being in poor or fair health, the 12th highest share of any state and well above the national average of 15%. One possible explanation for poorer health outcomes in North Carolina may be above average physical inactivity and obesity rates at 24.0% and 29.7%, respectively. Nationwide, 22% of adults get no exercise beyond getting up and going to work and 28% of adults are obese.\\n42. Arkansas\\nAdults drinking excessively: 15.3%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 28.4% (13th lowest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 22.7% (2nd highest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers, AR-MO\\nSome 15.3% of adults in Arkansas drink to excess, which is below the national average of 18.0%. States where binge drinking and drinking heavily are less common tend to have poorer health outcomes, despite the many negative health problems associated with excessive alcohol consumption. Drinking alcohol is an expensive unhealthy habit and tends to be less common in states with lower incomes — which often report worse health outcomes than wealthier states.\\nArkansas is no different. The state’s median annual household income of $44,334 is well below the national figure of $57,617. Some 22.7% of adults in the state report being in fair or poor health, the second largest share among all states.\\n41.

Excessive drinking is never healthy and Idaho’s low excessive drinking rate partially explains some positive health outcomes. A key measure of health is the premature death rate, and Idaho’s is below average. For every 100,000 state residents, 310 die before the age of 75. Nationwide, there are 333 deaths before age 75 for every 100,000 people.\\nAccording to the CDC, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to risky sexual behavior — and Idaho’s low excessive drinking rate may partially explain a low incidence of sexually transmitted diseases. There are 337 diagnoses of chlamydia per 100,000 state residents annually, one the lowest such rates among states and well below the U.S. rate of 456 per 100,000.\\n40. Maryland\\nAdults drinking excessively: 15.5%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 32.8% (20th highest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 13.3% (8th lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: California-Lexington Park, MD\\nSome 15.5% of adults in Maryland binge drink or drink heavily, which is less than the national share of American adults who drink in excess at 18.0%. According to the CDC, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to depression and anxiety — and Maryland’s low excessive drinking rate may help explain better than average mental health outcomes. Adults in the state report an average of just 3.4 mentally unhealthy days per month, fewer than the 3.7-day national average.\\nStates with smaller shares of adults who drink excessively tend to have lower median household incomes. Maryland, however, is the exception. The median annual household income in the state of $78,945 is the highest of any state and over $20,000 above the national median of $57,617.\\nMore: U.S. economy: A rundown of the poorest county in every state\\n39.

Drinking large quantities of alcohol can lead to many health issues, yet states with lower shares of adults drinking excessively tend to be less healthy than those with higher shares. For example, the premature death rate is higher in Nevada than in most states — likely due to several factors other than alcohol consumption. For every 100,000 people in Nevada, 360 die before the age of 75.\\n38.

Excessive drinking can lead to a slew of health conditions such as hypertension and liver disease. However, states with lower shares of adults who binge drink or drink heavily are typically less healthy than those with higher shares of adults who drink excessively. In Kentucky, nearly 21% of adults report they are in fair or poor health, the seventh highest share of all states. This could be because many of the states that report lower excessive drinking rates have lower incomes — and states with lower incomes and higher poverty rates tend to report less healthful behavior and worse health outcomes than wealthier states.\\nThis appears to be the case in Kentucky, which is one of the poorest states in the country. The state reports 25.9% smoking rate among adults, the highest of any state. Also, 32.9% of state adults are obese, which is well above the national obesity rate of 28%.\\n36.

The median income of households in the state is $49,501 a year, which is well below the nationwide median household income of $57,617. The poverty rate in South Carolina is 15.3%, one of the higher state poverty rates.\\nWhile drinking too much alcohol is unhealthy, it is only one factor that can cause adverse health effects. Obesity and smoking are some of the other factors. In South Carolina, 31.8% of adults are obese — the ninth highest share of any state — and the smoking rate is higher than the national average.\\n35.

Like many states reporting lower excessive drinking rates, incomes are lower in Indiana. The median household income of $52,314 a year, below the national median household income of $57,617.\\nDespite the relatively low excessive drinking rate in Indiana, the premature death rate in the state of 387 deaths before the age of 75 for every 100,000 people is the 10th highest. This is likely — at least in part — the result of the high obesity rate in the state, which at 31.7% is also the 10th highest of all states. Earning a low income makes it challenging to afford healthful food and and exercise opportunities, and the state’s low income helps explain its high obesity rate.\\n33.

In Virginia, 17.4% of adults report drinking to excess. States with lower portions of adults binge drinking or drinking heavily tend to report less healthy outcomes. That is likely because many of these states are generally poorer — and low income states tend to report worse health than wealthier states. The opposite is true for Virginia, however. The state’s median household income of $68,114 a year is well above the national median, and the poverty rate is just 11%. The nationwide poverty rate is 14%.\\nPartially due to the state’s higher incomes, Virginia adults tend to be quite healthy, reporting below-average obesity, smoking, and premature death rates.\\n29.

In Florida, the median household income of $50,860 a year is about $6,800 less than the national figure. Those with lower incomes often lack access to luxuries including alcohol and healthy foods. A diet that lacks a diversity of nutritious foods can result in poor health outcomes, which helps explain why 17.1% of adults in Florida report they are in fair or poor health.

Despite a lower frequency of adults drinking heavily, 35.3% of deaths from car crashes involve alcohol, the 10th highest share of any state. This factor, along with a higher smoking rate, may contribute to the above average premature death rate in Wyoming.

In California, the median household income of $67,739 a year is nearly $10,000 greater than the national income of $57,617 and one of the wealthiest states in America.\\nDespite higher rates of drinking excessively, adults in California are some of the healthiest in all the country. Only 22.7% of adults are obese, the third lowest share among all states and well below the national obesity rate of 28.0%. In addition, only 11.7% of adults smoke, the second lowest share nationwide. Both low obesity and smoking rates may have positively contributed to the state’s low premature death rate. At 468 deaths before age 75 for every 100,000 state residents, it is the third lowest premature death rate of any state.\\nMore: Most livable: America’s 50 best cities to live in\\n21. Pennsylvania\\nAdults drinking excessively: 18.1%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 32.0% (24th lowest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 15.3% (25th lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: State College, PA\\nAn estimated 18.1% of adults in Pennsylvania drink excessively, which slightly surpasses the national rate of 18%. Excessive drinking can lead to several serious health issues including cardiovascular disease and liver cancer. In Pennsylvania, where the excessive drinking rate is just slightly higher than the national rate, the premature death rate is also just slightly higher. For every 100,000 Pennsylvania residents, about 342 die before the age of 75, slightly more than the nationwide rate of 333 premature deaths per every 100,000.\\n20. New York\\nAdults drinking excessively: 18.2%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 23.0% (2nd lowest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 16.2% (23rd highest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Watertown-Fort Drum, NY\\nAt 18.2%, New York’s excessive drinking rate is roughly in line with that of the national share of 18%. Despite the fact that a slightly larger share of adults drink heavily or binge drink, driving deaths attributable to alcohol are rare compared to most states. Only 23% of all roadway fatalities involve alcohol, the second lowest share among any state and well below the national rate of 30%.\\nCLOSE US Soldiers in Japan have been banned from drinking, with their movements restricted after a Marine was arrested over a car crash which killed a local. Buzz60\\n19. New Hampshire\\nAdults drinking excessively: 18.4%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 31.2% (22nd lowest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 11.5% (2nd lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Manchester-Nashua, NH\\nNew Hampshire’s excessive drinking rate of 18.4% is slightly higher than the national figure of 18%. Despite a slightly above average excessive drinking rate, a strong majority of adults in New Hampshire report they are in good health. Only 11.5% report being in fair or poor health — the second lowest share of any state. The premature death rate is also quite low in New Hampshire, with 290 deaths before the age of 75, per every 100,000 residents, also one of the lowest shares among the states. With smoking being one of the leading causes of premature death, it is possible that the low smoking rate of just 15.9% — well below the national smoking rate of 18.0% — contributes to the lower premature death rate and better health outcomes overall.\\n18. Connecticut\\nAdults drinking excessively: 18.6%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 33.4% (18th highest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 14.3% (17th lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk, CT\\nAlcohol is not cheap, and wealthy individuals are more likely than lower-income individuals to be able to afford drinking on a regular basis. Connecticut is one of the wealthier states with a median household income of $73,433 a year, which greatly exceeds the comparable national income of $57,617. Some 18.6% of adults in the state binge or heavily drink, more than the comparable national share of 18%.\\nDespite the fact that excessive drinking is a common habit in the state, adults in Connecticut tend to report healthy outcomes. Of all adults in the state, about 1 in 4 are obese, one of the lowest obesity rates among all states and well below the national rate of 28.0%. In addition, only 13.5% of adults reportedly smoke, the third lowest rate of any state.\\nMore: Beers Americans no longer drink\\n17. Louisiana\\nAdults drinking excessively: 18.8%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 32.6% (22nd highest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 21.0% (5th highest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Houma-Thibodaux, LA\\nSome 18.8% of adults in Louisiana drink excessively, more than the 18% of adults who drink to excess nationwide. States with higher excessive drinking rates tend to be wealthier, at least in part because alcohol can be costly. In Louisiana, however, the median household income of $45,156 a year is well below the comparable national income of $57,617. The poverty rate in Louisiana is also incredibly high. At 20.2%, it is the second highest poverty rate among states and well above the the national rate of 14%.\\nBinge or heavy drinking can lead to a slew of health issues such as hypertension and cancer. Perhaps the high drinking rate in Louisiana contributes to the high premature death rate. For every 100,000 residents, 452 die before age 75, the sixth highest share among the states.\\n16. Oregon\\nAdults drinking excessively: 18.8%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 32.8% (19th highest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 18.3% (13th highest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, OR-WA\\nSome 18.8% of adults in Oregon binge or heavily drink, more than the national share of 18%. States with higher drinking rates tend to report better health outcomes, likely because they are also higher-income states. In Oregon, however, adults report relatively good health outcomes, despite both an average drinking rate and a median household income that is close to the national figure.\\nFor example, only 15.3% of adults lead sedentary lives, the second lowest share among states and well below the national rate of 22%. The high rate of adults in Oregon who routinely engage in physical activity has likely contributed to the state’s low obesity rate. Only 26.4% of adults are obese in Oregon — below the nationwide obesity rate of 28%.\\n15. Colorado\\nAdults drinking excessively: 19.1%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 34.7% (13th highest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 13.7% (11th lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Fort Collins, CO\\nAn estimated 19.1% of adults in Colorado drink excessively, a larger share than in most states and more than the 18% excessive drinking rate nationwide. Despite a greater likelihood of alcohol abuse, adults in Colorado are healthier than most Americans by other important measures. For example, just 14.4% of adults in the state lead sedentary lives, the smallest share of any state and well below the 22% physical inactivity rate nationwide. Active lifestyles partly explain some healthy outcomes in Colorado. Just 20.2% of the state’s adult population are obese, the smallest share of any state.\\n14. Ohio\\nAdults drinking excessively: 19.2%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 34.3% (14th highest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 15.3% (24th lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Columbus, OH\\nSome 19.2% of adults drink excessively in Ohio, more than the comparable national share of 18%. Binge drinking and heavy drinking are not healthy behaviors and can lead to a slew of health complications and disease, including stroke and cardiovascular disease. Such serious ailments can shorten life. In Ohio, the premature death rate is higher than in most states and above the national average. For every 100,000 residents, an estimated 382 die before the age of 75, the 12th highest share of any state.\\nExcessive drinking is just one factor that impacts health negatively. Ohio adults also report above average obesity and smoking rates at 31.4% and 21.6%, respectively.\\n13. Massachusetts\\nAdults drinking excessively: 19.5%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 27.8% (10th lowest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 14.2% (15th lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Barnstable Town, MA\\nNearly 1 in 5 adults living in Massachusetts drink excessively, a larger share than in the majority of states. Aside from a greater tendency to engage in binge drinking or heavy drinking, Massachusetts residents tend to be relatively healthy. For example, just 14% of the adult population smokes, well below the 18% national adult smoking rate. Additionally, just 20.3% of adults in the state get no exercise beyond getting up and going to work, a lower physical inactivity rate than the comparable 22% U.S. share.\\n12. Vermont\\nAdults drinking excessively: 19.6%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 33.4% (17th highest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 11.4% (the lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Burlington-South Burlington, VT\\nThe excessive drinking rate in of 19.6% in Vermont is one of the highest in the nation and higher than the national average of 18%. Despite the higher excessive drinking rate, a strong majority of adults report they are in good health. Only 11.4% report poor health, the lowest share of any state.\\nExercise is an important determinant of good health, and 81.5% of Vermont adults are physically active — more than in most states and above the national average of 78%. The high physical activity rate may have contributed to the low obesity rate of 24.4%, the sixth lowest of any state and well below the national obesity rate at 28%.\\nMore: Least livable: 50 worst cities to live in\\n11. Maine\\nAdults drinking excessively: 19.6%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 39.8% (4th highest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 14.9% (21st lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Portland-South Portland, ME\\nMaine is the heaviest-drinking state in New England and the 11th heaviest-drinking in the United States. An estimated 19.6% of adults in Maine either binge drink or drink heavily compared to 18% of American adults. The relatively high excessive drinking rate partially explains the high incidence of deadly car accidents in the state that are related to alcohol. Alcohol is involved in nearly 40% of all roadway fatalities in Maine, a larger share than all but three other states.\\n10. Michigan\\nAdults drinking excessively: 20.0%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 29.4% (16th lowest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 16.8% (20th highest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Lansing-East Lansing, MI\\nSome 20% of adults drink to excess in Michigan, more than the comparable national share of 18%. Typically, states with higher rates of adults who binge or heavily drink are wealthier and are more likely to report better health outcomes. Michigan is an exception with a below average median household income and worse health outcomes than most states.\\n9. Nebraska\\nAdults drinking excessively: 20.4%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 35.6% (9th highest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 13.4% (10th lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Lincoln, NE\\nMore than 1 in 5 adults living in Nebraska drink excessively, more than the comparable national share of 18%. Drinking large quantities of alcohol overtime can negatively impact both mental and physical health, leading to anything from anxiety and depression to high blood pressure and liver disease.\\nDespite the high excessive drinking rate among adults in Nebraska, only 13.4% of adults feel as though they are in poor health, one of the lowest shares among any state and well below the national average of 15%. The premature death rate is also quite low in Nebraska. For every 100,000 residents, only 306 die before the age of 75, among one of the lowest shares in any state.\\nCLOSE Drinking heavily and smoking for years are well-known features of an unhealthy lifestyle. They can also make you look older, according to a new study Time\\n8. Hawaii\\nAdults drinking excessively: 20.5%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 38.0% (5th highest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 13.1% (7th lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Kahului-Wailuku-Lahaina, HI\\nSome 20.5% of the adult population in Hawaii drinks to excess, well above the comparable national share of 18.0%. Not surprisingly, the state reports one of the highest rates of driving deaths in which alcohol is a factor, at 38% of all fatalities, the fifth highest share in the country.\\nWealthier states are more likely to have higher drinking rates and report better health outcomes. In Hawaii, where the median household income of $74,511 a year is nearly $17,000 greater than the national income of $57,617, adults report better health outcomes than almost any other state. For example, only 13.1% of adults report they are in fair or poor health, the seventh lowest share of any state. Also, Hawaii’s obesity rate of 22.3% is well below the national rate of 28% and is the second lowest of any state.\\n7. Iowa\\nAdults drinking excessively: 21.0%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 25.4% (7th lowest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 12.3% (4th lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Iowa City, IA\\nSome 21% of adults in Iowa drink excessively, the seventh highest share among all states and more than the national excessive drinking rate of 18%. Frequently drinking to excess can be very detrimental to health, leading to a variety of health issues such as hypertension and digestive complications. Despite the higher drinking rate in Iowa, only 12.3% of adults report poor health outcomes, the fourth lowest share of any state.\\n6. Minnesota\\nAdults drinking excessively: 21.1%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 30.9% (21st lowest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 11.9% (3rd lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Mankato-North Mankato, MN\\nIn Minnesota, 21.1% of adults report binge or heavy drinking, one of the highest excessive drinking rates of any state and well above the national share of 18%. Excessive drinking rates tend to be higher among wealthier populations, and Minnesota has a larger median household income than most states at $65,599 per year, which is well above the national income of $57,617.\\nDespite being home to a large adult population who drinks to excess on a regular basis, Minnesota adults appear to be quite healthy. Minnesota has the lowest premature death rate of any state at 262 deaths before age 75 per every 100,000 residents.\\nMore: Quality of life: 25 healthiest communities for retirement\\n5.

Montana\\nAdults drinking excessively: 21.8%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 46.3% (2nd highest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 14.2% (16th lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Missoula, MT\\nStates with higher excessive drinking rates are more prone to driving deaths that involve alcohol. With 21.8% of adults in Montana binge drinking or drinking heavily, the fourth highest share of any state, alcohol is a very common factor in roadway fatalities. Of all roadway fatalities in the state, 46.3% are attributable to alcohol consumption, the second highest share among all states.\\n3. Alaska\\nAdults drinking excessively: 22.1%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 33.8% (16th highest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 13.7% (12th lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Fairbanks, AK\\nSome 22.1% of adults in Alaska report drinking excessively, the third highest share of all states and well above the comparable national share of 18%. States with higher excessive drinking rates tend to be wealthier, partially because alcohol can be expensive to buy regularly. In Alaska, the median household income of $76,440 a year is the second largest of any state, greatly exceeds the national income of $57,617.\\n2. Wisconsin\\nAdults drinking excessively: 24.5%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 36.9% (8th highest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 14.0% (13th lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Green Bay, WI\\nSome 24.5% of adults in Wisconsin report binge or heavy drinking — the second largest share of any state and well above the comparable national share of 18%.

Despite high rates of excessive drinking, Wisconsin has a relatively low premature death rate. For every 100,000 residents, about 300 will die before the age of 75, less deaths than in most other states.\\n1. North Dakota\\nAdults drinking excessively: 24.7%\\nAlcohol-related driving deaths: 46.7% (the highest)\\nAdults in fair or poor health: 13.4% (9th lowest)\\nDrunkest metro area: Fargo, ND-MN\\nThe state with the highest share of adults drinking excessively is North Dakota, with nearly 25% of adults reporting binge drinking or drinking heavily. Not surprisingly, the state with the highest drinking rate also has the highest rate of alcohol-related driving deaths. A total of 46.7% of all roadway fatalities are attributable to alcohol consumption, much higher than the national share of 30%.\\nDrinking excessively on a regular basis is not healthy. Still, 13.4% of adults report they are in fair or poor health, despite the state’s above average obesity and smoking rates.\\nTo identify the drunkest states in America, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the percentage of men and women over 18 who report binge or heavy drinking in every state. Excessive alcohol consumption, according to the CDC, includes binge drinking and heavy drinking. Binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks in a single occasion for women and five or more for men, and heavy drinking is defined as at least eight drinks per week for women and 15 for men.

Kissinger’s negotiations led directly to Nixon’s historic visit to China some months later.\\nNixon had reshuffled the diplomatic deck and played the China card. As a result, the strategic calculus that had governed the Cold War for decades underwent a tectonic shift in America’s favor.\\nNow we learn that CIA Director Mike Pompeo secretly met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un on Easter weekend. President Trump has confirmed that Pompeo’s negotiations have laid the groundwork for a summit in late May or early June to discuss the rogue state’s nuclear weapons program. “Denuclearization would be a great thing for the world, as well as for North Korea,” the President tweeted.\\nLike Nixon, Trump is boldly reshuffling the deck. And, in like manner, the strategic calculus that has governed the standoff on the Korean Peninsula for decades is starting to shift in our favor.\\nIn January, Kim Jong-un suddenly agreed to talks with the South, and in February sent a team to South Korea’s Winter Olympics. The first summit between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Kim will take place on April 27. In a further surprise, the North Korean dictator has apparently agreed to discuss formally ending the Korean War, which began when his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, invaded the south some 68 years ago.\\nThe most startling news is that Pyongyang, according to South Korea’s president, has just agreed to Trump’s demand for “complete denuclearization.” And this without any strings attached, such as the withdrawal of American troops.\\nKim Jong-un was even galvanized — again by Trump, of course – to venture beyond the borders of his hermit kingdom for the first time since assuming power in 2011. In late March, Kim visited his chief international patron (and fellow president for life), Chinese President Xi Jinping.\\nAccording to the Nikkei Asian Review, Xi talked to Kim about the ongoing power struggle between the U.S. and China, and what it means in the context of something called “Project 2035.” Project 2035 is a grand scheme for building China into a “great modern socialist country” by the year 2035. Announced at last October’s National Party Congress, its goal is a China that is stronger in both economic and military terms than the United States.\\nWhy would Xi share his “China Dream” of one day becoming the world’s dominant power with Kim? Perhaps to remind him that at the present time, in the face of renewed U.S. confidence, economic growth, and military resolve, it is better to be conciliatory with Trump. “I’m playing the long game,” he may have suggested to Kim. “You should, too.”\\nNone of this would have happened if the hapless Hillary Clinton had been elected. Like previous American presidents, she would probably have tried to once again bribe North Korea into behaving itself. And like previous presidents from her husband on, she would have only thereby encouraged further extortionate behavior.\\nIt is Trump’s toughness that has gotten us this far. Instead of bribing North Korea to suspend its weapons and missile programs, he is choking it (and its giant neighbor to the north) with ever-tightening sanctions.\\nBolstering the sanctions regime is the threat of military action, made credible by the near-annihilation of the Islamic State and the surgical strikes in Syria, among other things. Young Kim knows that, if a denuclearization agreement can’t be hammered out, that he might wake up one morning to find his nuclear and missile facilities a smoldering ruin.\\nWe used to say that only Nixon, with his strong anti-communist credentials, could have gone to China.\\nIt may well turn out to be the case that only Trump, with his steely resolve, can broker a deal with Kim.\\nIt is still early days, but the end of the Korean War and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would fundamentally change the strategic calculus of East Asia.\\nOf course, Nixon going to China was not an unmixed blessing. Although the U.S.-China détente increased the pressure on the Soviet Union while helping hundreds of millions of Chinese escape poverty, it also contributed to the rise of a Chinese Party-State that is increasingly hostile to everything America stands for.\\nIn the case of North Korea, our goal must be to (1) convince Little Rocket Man to give up his dangerous toys and (2) reconcile himself to living with his southern neighbors in peace. In so doing, we should be careful not to strengthen his despotic regime which – with or without nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles – will continue to repress its own people.\\nWith the North Korean threat off the strategic chessboard, America and its allies can focus on the real danger to the present world order: China itself.\\nSteven W.

Looking back, I also hear the plaintive wail of a desperate child who believes he is alone in the world with no one to care for him. “I alone can do it” is Trump’s survival response to: “I must do it all alone.”\\nThere are two Trumps. The one he presents to the world is all bluster, bullying and certainty. The other, which I have long felt haunts his inner world, is the frightened child of a relentlessly critical and bullying father and a distant and disengaged mother who couldn’t or wouldn’t protect him.\\n“That’s why I’m so screwed up, because I had a father who pushed me so hard,” Trump acknowledged in 2007, in a brief and rare moment of self-awareness.\\nYou can say what you like on Twitter – as long as you’re US president | Christian Christensen Read more\\nTrump’s temperament and his habits have hardened with age. He was always cartoonish, but compared with the man for whom I wrote The Art of the Deal 30 years ago, he is significantly angrier today: more reactive, deceitful, distracted, vindictive, impulsive and, above all, self-absorbed – assuming the last is possible.\\nThis is the narrative I’ve been advancing for the past 18 months. With the recent publication of Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury, it turns out that even those closest to Trump recognise his utter lack of fitness to be president, even if they are too cowed and cowardly to do anything about it.\\nFear is the hidden through-line in Trump’s life – fear of weakness, of inadequacy, of failure, of criticism and of insignificance. He has spent his life trying to outrun these fears by “winning” – as he puts it – and by redefining reality whenever the facts don’t serve the narrative he seeks to create. It hasn’t worked, but not for lack of effort.\\nIn his first year in office, Trump has lambasted any facts he dislikes as “fake news”, while making nearly 2,000 false or misleading claims of his own – more than five a day. In a single half-hour interview with the New York Times in late December, he made 24 such claims. This is the very definition of gaslighting – lying until you get people to doubt their own reality – and it is both frightening and disturbing. Because the office Trump now occupies makes him the most powerful man on Earth, his fears, and the way he manages them, have necessarily become ours.\\nWe fear Trump because he is impulsive, irrational and self-serving, but above all because he seems unconstrained by even the faintest hint of conscience. Trump feels no more shame over his most destructive behaviours than a male lion does killing the cubs of his predecessor when he takes over a pride.\\nTrump has made fear the dominant emotion of our times. This, I believe, is his primary impact on the body politic after a year in office. He began his campaign by describing immigrant Mexicans as rapists, Muslims as terrorists, and more recently all black and brown people, and entire countries, as inferior. Trump skilfully exploited the fears of supporters who felt powerless and disenfranchised by presenting himself as their angry champion, even though the policies he has since pursued are likely to make their lives worse.\\nAbout the only thing Trump truly has in common with his base is that he feels every bit as aggrieved as they do, despite his endless privilege. No amount of money, fame or power has been enough to win him the respect he so insatiably craves. His anger over this perceived injustice is visceral and authentic. Trump’s unwinding of government programmes such as Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act will fuel yet more fear among the millions of people will lose their health care in the year ahead. The tax plan Trump pushed through most benefits him, his family and his fellow billionaires and provides the least relief to those who need it most. In both cases, the victims of these policies will include millions of his supporters who may find someone else to blame, but whose suffering will inexorably increase.\\nxmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"> The Trumpian world view is narrow, dark and deficit-driven\\nThe fearful divide Trump has exacerbated is not simply between his supporters and his detractors, the rich and the poor, or Democrats and Republicans, but between the best and the worst in each of us.\\nIn the face of fear, it is a physiological fact that our most primitive and selfish instincts emerge. Control of our behaviour shifts from the prefrontal cortex to the emotionally driven amygdala – sometimes referred to as “fear central”. As we move into fight-or-flight mode, we become more self-centred, and our vision narrows to the perceived threat, which in the modern world is less to our survival than to our sense of value and worthiness. We lose the capacity for empathy, rationality, proportionality and attention to the longer-term consequences of our actions.\\nThis is the reactive state Trump has tapped into with his followers and which he has prompted in his opponents. It serves none of us well. Think for a moment about the immense difference between how you feel and behave at your best and your worst. It is when we feel safest and most secure that we think most clearly and expansively. It’s also when we are most inclined to look beyond our self-interest, and to act with compassion, generosity, consideration and forgiveness.\\nI have never observed any of these qualities in Trump. Over the past year I have frequently been asked whether he has any redeeming qualities. I’ve thought about this as objectively as I can, and the only one I’ve come up with is his relentless drive. But because Trump uses this quality solely in the service of his self-aggrandisement and domination, it scarcely qualifies as a virtue.\\nSo what does resistance to Trump look like? This is a question that has preoccupied me and millions of other Americans this past year. If fear gets sufficiently intense, or persists for long enough, we eventually move into “freeze” – meaning numbness and submission. This is my own greatest fear. As Trump violates one norm after another day after day, the risk is that we lose our sense of outrage and our motivation to speak out.\\nThe challenge we face is to resist our own fear without sacrificing our outrage. That requires widening our perspective beyond Trump’s, and beyond Trump himself. The future is ours to shape, not his. Dispiriting as I found it to write The Art of the Deal with a man I progressively came to view as a black hole, the experience prompted me to redirect my life in almost complete opposition to the values and world view that he represents. My own path over the past two decades – prompted in reaction to my experience with him – has been to help business leaders become more wholly human, and to humanise workplaces.\\nTrump’s actions over the past year have already prompted an extraordinary wave of new activism among people in their 20s and 30s, who are now the biggest segment of the US electorate, and represent the next generation of leaders. The 19 women who stepped forward to accuse Trump of sexual assault have helped to galvanise a rapidly growing, worldwide movement to empower women and to call out sexual abuse in the workplace. Thanks in large part to Trump, hundreds of new female candidates are now running for political office.\\n‘Shithole countries’? Words worthy of a racist-in-chief | Richard Wolffe Read more\\nTrump himself has become the embodiment of the limits of traditional masculinity. “We raise boys,” writes the author Terrence Real, “to live in a world in which they are either winners or losers, grandiose or shame-filled, … perpetrators or victims. Society shows little mercy for men if they fail in the performance of their role. But the price of that performance is an inward sickness.”\\nTrump represents an extreme version of a sickness from which most men suffer, to some extent. The most powerful stand we can take in opposition to Trump’s values and behaviour is to pursue a higher purpose every day, seek more common ground amid our differences, and find better ways to take care of others and add value wherever we can. As he looks backward, we must look forward.\\nThe Trumpian worldview is narrow, dark and deficit-driven. Each of us shares some of those instincts: the fear of inadequacy is uniquely and universally human. But we are also capable of so much more. My hope and belief is that Trump will no longer be president by this year’s end. My personal commitment is to pay much less attention to him, and more to making a difference to others affected by his policies. Whatever happens, may the worst of Trump inspire the best in us.\\nWe, together, can do it.\\n• Tony Schwartz is the chief executive of The Energy Project.

It also raised questions about whether a cheaper testing method should be used.\\nIn more than 4 million blood donations checked in the United States, nine tested positive for the Zika virus. Of those, three were considered an infection threat.\\n\"We can\\'t afford to spend that kind of money to find a single case,\" said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University infectious diseases expert who was not involved in the research.\\nZika infections swept across Latin America and the Caribbean in 2015 and 2016, with a few very small outbreaks in the southern United States. The virus is mainly spread by tropical mosquitoes, but scientists also discovered some infections were spread through sex.\\nFearing Zika might also spread through transfusions, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2016 called on all blood banks to screen for it.\\n\"The risk from transfusion was poorly known. We put this testing in place as a precaution without really having solid data about the necessity for it,\" said Dr. Darrell Triulzi, a University of Pittsburgh transfusion medicine specialist.\\nThe new study is the first large one to evaluate whether the testing made sense, he added.\\nThe researchers looked at the results of screenings done by the American Red Cross, which collects 42 percent of the U.S. blood supply. They focused on donations from the Lower 48 states from June 2016 to September 2017.\\nHealth officials say there have been four transfusion-related Zika cases reported in Brazil, but none in the United States.\\nIn a related journal article, four Johns Hopkins University medical experts questioned whether it makes sense to maintain intensive testing for Zika.\\nThe FDA has never before revoked a recommendation to test blood donations for a potentially harmful germ, and it\\'s unlikely the agency would do that now, experts said.\\nBut the agency could call for a less intensive screening called mini-pool testing. Rather than running a test on each separate donor, mini-pool testing involves mixing samples from 16 donors and testing the batch. When a batch tests positive, individual testing is done to find the tainted donation.\\nThat\\'s what\\'s done with West Nile virus and other germs, experts said.\\nMini-pool testing would cut the cost of Zika testing in half, said Susan Stramer, one of the study\\'s authors and vice president of scientific affairs at the Red Cross.\\nDetails from the study were presented to an FDA advisory committee in December.

We do not want to skimp on simple pleasures and die with lots of money in the bank. But we also don\\'t want to run through our savings too soon. So how do we calculate withdrawals from our nest egg to spend as much as possible of our assets before we shuffle off this mortal coil? --E.S.\\nYou\\'d think that having a great time spending all the money you\\'ve socked away for retirement would be a cinch. After all, the whole point of saving and investing in 401(k)s and other retirement accounts during your working years is to enjoy yourself after calling it a career.\\nBut a number of recent studies suggest that many people may have a harder time spending down their retirement nest egg than you may think. For example, a 2016 study of retiree spending habits found that with the exception of those of modest means, retirees on average were spending less then they could actually afford, while wealthy retirees were spending less than half of the amount their savings and other resources would support.\\nAnd last year when researchers for the BlackRock Retirement Institute examined the spending and savings of thousands of people who retired in the early 1990s, they not only found that most of these retirees still had at least half of their retirement savings remaining after nearly 20 years of retirement, but that many actually had a larger nest egg than when when they entered retirement.\\nThere can be several explanations for this seeming reluctance to spend down one\\'s savings. Some retirees, especially those with considerable amounts of money tucked away, may plan on leaving a portion of their savings to their heirs or charity. Many are no doubt being cautious because they fear they\\'ll incur large medical expenses late in life or that they\\'ll run through their savings too early and have to scrimp in their dotage.\\nBut others may simply have trouble making the transition from saving to spending. After years of thrift, they have developed an extreme reluctance to spend, or a condition I\\'ve dubbed \"Spendaphobia,\" which makes it difficult for them to loosen their purse strings and enjoy the benefits of all those years of saving for the future.\\nRelated: A 3-step plan to a secure retirement\\nWhich brings us back to your question: How do you improve your chances of spending so that you enjoy your time in retirement as much as you can, yet not overdo it and jeopardize your financial security or even outlive your nest egg?\\nThe best way to start is by doing a full-fledged retirement budget, as this will give you a sense of what your actual expenses will be after you retire and how much you\\'ll have to spend to maintain your current standard of living. You can create such a budget by going to an online tool like BlackRock\\'s Retirement Expense Worksheet, which allows you to enter upwards of 50 expense items in eight broad categories that cover both essential (housing, health care, food, transportation, etc.) and discretionary (entertainment, charitable contributions, whatever) spending.\\nYou won\\'t be able to predict your spending with 100% certainty (although, if you do some lifestyle planning, or giving serious thought to how you\\'ll live after you retire, you\\'ll come away with a more accurate estimate than if you just wing it). But the idea is to do the best you can and then refine your estimates as you near and enter retirement.\\nOnce you have a decent idea of how much you\\'ll need to spend (at least initially), you\\'ll want to gauge whether Social Security, any pensions and draws from your savings will be able to support that level of spending. You can make that assessment by going to a good retirement calculator like T. Rowe Price\\'s Retirement Income Calculator.\\nYou enter such information as your age, current income, the current value of your savings and the amount you expect to receive from any pensions and Social Security (the tool will automatically estimate your payment or you can go to Social Security\\'s Retirement Estimator). The tool will then estimate the chances that your savings will be able to generate enough income (after taking Social Security and any pensions into account) for the rest of your life to support your desired level of spending. (If you plan to leave assets to charity or heirs, you can earmark that amount and exclude it from the analysis.)\\nTo feel reasonably secure that you won\\'t outlive your savings, I\\'d think you\\'d want to see an estimate of 80% or better that your savings will last a lifetime. Generally, if you start with an initial annual withdrawal equal to 3% to 4% of savings -- or $30,000 to $40,000 for a $1 million nest egg -- and then adjust that amount each year for inflation to maintain purchasing power, you\\'ll likely come in close to that 80%-or-better target.\\nIf the tool estimates a success rate much lower than that, however, you may want to revise your planned spending down a bit. Conversely, if the chances of your savings supporting you the rest of your life come in a lot higher than 80%, you might consider spending some more.\\nBut whatever level of spending you start with, you need to be ready to adjust it up or down as conditions change. For example, if your nest egg\\'s value declines sharply because the financial markets take a big hit as they did during the 2008 financial crisis, you may want to forgo an inflation increase or even scale back your planned withdrawal to avoid running through your assets too soon.\\nIf, on the other hand, your savings balance begins to balloon because the markets are churning out well-above-average gains, as has been the case in recent years, you may want to splurge a bit and boost your spending so that you don\\'t end up with a big pile of assets late in retirement along with regrets you didn\\'t spend more early in retirement when you might have enjoyed yourself more.\\nBy making such adjustments and periodically re-visiting a retirement income calculator throughout retirement with updated information about your savings balance and planned withdrawals, you should be able to get a sense of whether you\\'re spending down your nest egg at a \"Goldilocks\" pace, i.e., not too fast but not too slow.\\nRelated: How much income will you actually need in retirement?\\nOne more thing you can do to boost your odds of having a happier and more rewarding retirement is spend in ways that have been shown to generate more satisfaction and happiness for retirees.\\nWhen Michael Finke of The American College and other researchers looked last year at the spending habits of some 1,500 retirees, they concluded that only one type of spending predicted retirement satisfaction -- namely, the money they spend on leisure activities, including travel, entertainment, dining out and hobbies. Finke believes such spending tends to boost happiness because it keeps us more active and socially engaged. (For what it\\'s worth, Merrill Lynch research has found that seniors who give back in some way, whether volunteering or contributing to organizations whose values and aims they support, were more likely to say they were happier and had a strong sense of purpose in life.)\\nNeither I nor anyone else can offer a spending formula or specific withdrawal percentage that will guarantee you won\\'t run through your savings while you\\'re still alive and kicking while ensuring that you won\\'t leave behind any more money than you wish. There are too many uncertainties -- how the markets will perform, how long you\\'ll live, how your spending needs might change, etc. -- for such guarantees.\\nBut if you start with a level of spending that\\'s reasonable, monitor and adjust your outlays as you go along and to the extent possible direct your spending to areas that have the highest happiness payoff so to speak, you should be able to enjoy retirement and get the most out of money you\\'ve managed to save.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Both Japanese and American flu patients were included in the trial.\\nThe experimental drug worked three times faster than another antiviral drug, Tamiflu, the company told the Journal.\\nThe drug uses a different approach to fight the flu than other medications.

Then, the newly copied viruses break out of the cell, spreading to other cells nearby and repeating the process.\\nExisting drugs, including Tamiflu, work to block these viral copies from escaping the cell, the Journal reported. The experimental drug, however, kicks into action earlier, working to block the virus from hijacking cells in the first place, the Journal said.\\nJapanese drug regulators could approve the drug for use in Japan by early March, the Journal reported.

His meeting with Kim marks the highest-level contact between the two countries since 2000, when then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Kim Jong Il, the current leader\\'s late father, to discuss strategic issues. Then-Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. visited the country in 2014 to secure the release of two American captives and met with a lower-level intelligence official.\"\\nPompeo, who is awaiting confirmation to succeed Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, \"has been dealing with North Korean representatives through a channel that runs between the C.I.A. and its North Korean counterpart, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, according to other officials.

The U.S. played a key role in the bitterly fought Korea War that ended in an armistice – not a peace treaty – in 1953. North and South Korea have technically been in a state of war ever since.\\nGiven his harsh words for Pyongyang and its leader, Kim, since taking office — including his threat to respond to Pyongyang\\'s missile tests with \"fire and fury\" — Trump signaled a more conciliatory note in the news conference with Abe.\\n\"I really believe there\\'s a lot of good will. They do respect us. We are respectful of them,\" the president said.\\n\"They do have my blessing to discuss the end of the war,\" he said. \"Subject to a deal, they have my blessing.\"\\nFor his part, Abe, whose country has been a frequent target of North Korea\\'s ire and a would-be target of its ballistic missiles, praised Trump for his \"unwavering determination in addressing the challenge of North Korea.\"\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

But now the plans have collapsed amid accusations of fraud – all strongly denied – leaving the cities scarred with abandoned building sites and a trail of angry investors from around the world demanding to know where their money has gone.\\nOn Norfolk Street, in Liverpool’s trendy Baltic Quarter, stands the six-storey concrete carcass of what was supposed to be Baltic House, launched in 2015 as a “groundbreaking” development of student flats and creative live-work units. It was the first phase of the Gallery+ project, an “elegant, cool, urban and edgy” mixed-use scheme, centred around a gallery of Banksy murals that had been ripped from nearby walls. It was one of many such glamorous projects devised by property company North Point Global, marketed with great fanfare in China and Hong Kong and sold off-plan to investors with the lucrative promise of high yields, before mysteriously grinding to a halt. Three years on, the company has pulled out of its planned £360m suite of projects across the city and stopped picking up the phone, leaving buyers to believe they are the victims of a ruthless scam, fiercely denied by the developers in question.\\nHow Baltic House was supposed to look – and how it looked last week\\n“We all thought the UK was a safe place to invest,” says Florence Leung, a retired Hong Kong accountant who put a substantial chunk of her life savings into a unit in Baltic House, and has since had to return to work to make ends meet.\\nAlong with many others, Leung said she was wooed at a lavish promotional roadshow at a hotel in Hong Kong and convinced to pay 80% of the price of a student flat upfront, with promises of 6% interest on her deposit, followed by guaranteed 9% returns in rental income once the project was finished. Months later, buyers received requests for further funds to complete the building, before North Point Global announced it was stopping work all together – and couldn’t refund the buyers’ deposits.\\nRevealed: the collapsed UK property schemes luring small investors Read more\\nGroups of frustrated buyers have since raised what they believe to be serious conflicts of interest, with the same individuals simultaneously acting as directors of the development companies, contractors and independent surveyors – claims that have been denied by all parties involved.\\nQ&A What is buyer-funded development? Show Hide It is an increasingly popular model of financing property developments by using deposits from many individual buyers. Apartments are sold off-plan to buyers, often overseas, who pay substantial deposits of up to 80% upfront. Their money is used to fund the entire project, from marketing fees to construction costs. The model has become more commonplace since the financial crisis of 2008, after which it became harder for developers to borrow from banks and institutional lenders to fund their schemes. It is seen as a risky form of investment as construction often begins without the commitment of funding to complete it, and there is no safety net if costs balloon beyond projections and funds run out. The Solicitors’ Regulation Authority has warned of \"substantial risks” of misappropriation of money the developer failing to deliver on the proposal or becoming insolvent, with buyers “unwittingly financing high risk or fraudulent property development.”\\n“The UK government must take action,” says James To Kun-sun, a member of Hong Kong’s legislative council, who has been inundated with complaints from hundreds of local buyers claiming they have been victims of UK property fraud. He estimates more than 700 buyers have lost an average of HK$500,000 (£45,000) in Hong Kong alone, with many more across Asia and beyond. “People here have a sentimental link with the UK, as a place with a responsible government, democracy and the rule of law, so it is shocking that this can be allowed to happen. It seems the development industry isn’t properly regulated and politicians are willing to endorse any kind of project. In Hong Kong we reformed our system 40 years ago, so buyers’ deposits cannot be released to the developer until a project is completed.”\\nBuyers were aghast to discover that most of their money had been spent before a single brick had been laid\\nIn 2015, then-chancellor George Osborne led a UK government trade mission to China, accompanied by the Mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, to trumpet the “golden era” of Sino-British relations. They were there to sell the Northern Pitchbook, a £24bn catalogue of investment opportunities, one highlight of which was Liverpool’s New Chinatown. Devised by North Point Global, this flagship £200m development of 800 luxury flats was to stand in the shadow of the Anglican Cathedral, as a dramatic cluster of angular towers rising above a Chinese bazaar.\\n“We have an idea, because of Liverpool’s links to China, of a new Chinese-themed attraction to bring it all to life,” Osborne told the Liverpool Echo in September 2015, speaking on the phone from Chengdu. “I’ve just been talking to one of the Chinese investors at the Liverpool stand,” he continued. “And Joe and I were going at it as a tag team, to try and persuade him to put his money into Liverpool.”\\n‘Joe and I were going at it as a tag team’ ... George Osborne, then chancellor, pictured with the mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, describes how the pair promoted some of the failed property schemes in Asia\\nLittle did Osborne know that the project he was so eagerly promoting would end in limbo, with investors out of pocket, contractors in administration and the council taking the developer to court.\\n“Liverpool’s reputation has been trashed,” says Cllr Richard Kemp, leader of the city’s Liberal Democrats. “Buyers were led to believe these projects were backed by the council, because of the mayor and his deputy’s promotional visits, but they were nothing of the sort. The council flogged off the land without doing any due diligence on who they were selling it to, and now we won’t see the money.”\\nDeputy mayor Gary Millar, meanwhile, has travelled to China and Hong Kong at least seven times in the last five years to promote investment opportunities in Liverpool, and has been pictured toasting buyers at North Point Global promotional events. He denies any wrongdoing. “I completely understand the investors’ frustration with their stalled schemes,” he told the Liverpool Echo. “However, I know I did nothing wrong.”\\nHow they did it\\nThis risky form of buyer-funded development (sometimes known as investor-led fractional sales) has mushroomed since the 2008 financial crisis, after which banks grew reluctant to finance property. Instead, many developers have turned to individual buyers to fund the entire cost of development, using their hefty deposits to pay for everything from marketing to professional fees and construction costs. Whereas a conventional model of off-plan development sees the buyers’ deposits (typically 10% of purchase price) held in a secure escrow account, and only released on completion of the building, this alternative form of buyer-funded development sees investors paying up to 80%, which can be spent on all manner of costs and fees before construction has even begun.\\nA close network of individuals crop up in different companies, \\u200b\\u200boften registered to the same address\\n“It’s an incredibly risky form of investment,” says Clifford Tibber, expert in property law at Anthony Gold solicitors. “Very often the developments are not legitimate ... Developers are bypassing banks and targeting unsophisticated individuals who are willing to throw their life savings at a chance of making big profits.”\\nLast year the Solicitors Regulation Authority warned solicitors not to get involved in such projects: “our view is that they involve consumer clients unwittingly financing high risk or fraudulent property development”. The SRA notice describes a process whereby “investors provide money for a ‘deposit’ which is released to the seller upon some (often spurious) condition. [...] This carries substantial risks such as the money being misappropriated, the seller failing to complete the scheme or the seller becoming insolvent.”\\nIn the last year, the SRA has taken action against eight law firms involved in such schemes and investigated cases with reported investor losses of over £100m. The northwest regional organised crime unit, Titan, is now considering a number of cases, after hundreds of buyers have come forward with similar allegations.\\nThe Angelgate development in Manchester. More than £30m was taken in buyers deposits before the firm went into administration\\nOne of the most prominent is the Angelgate development in Manchester, a scheme of 344 luxury apartments launched in 2015 by Pinnacle, a company linked to former convicted conman Tony Freeman, whose home was reportedly raided in July 2017 over a £3m tax fraud probe. Pinnacle said the raid was a personal investigation and nothing to do with the company, and said Freeman works for it as a consultant but denied that he has any involvement in the firm’s ownership. Once again, the Angelgate units were sold off-plan to investors, many in Asia, with more than £30m taken in buyers’ deposits before the firm was forced into administration last year.\\nBuyers were aghast to discover that most of their money had already been spent before a single brick had been laid. As the administrator’s report states: “It is not clear how on any basis [Pinnacle] could justify spending 40% of the funds received from buyers on sales and marketing commissions,” adding that an additional £5.1m had been paid to the contractor, despite no construction work having begun. A spokesperson for Pinnacle insists that “foundational work” had been conducted, and blames the situation on the collapse of the contractor, PHD1, which had “significantly under-valued the build”.\\n‘Outrageous’\\nSurveyor David Choules, whose company Inca Management was responsible for certifying the stages of work, agrees that the developer’s fees were “considerable and outrageous”. “They changed their financial appraisal a couple of times during the project and decided to take out more fees,” he says. “But, as the certifier, it wasn’t our position to challenge that. We can have an opinion, but it’s down to the lawyers to advise.”\\nDeputy mayor of Liverpool Gary Millar (left) and Peter McInnes (right) with Samson Law of Hong Kong Homes at a promotional event for Asian investors. Millar travelled to Asia seven times. McInnes has been linked to a pair of jailed gangsters\\nSolicitor David Roberts, the lawyer who managed the buyers’ accounts for a number of these failed schemes, says: “Our role was to administer the funds in accordance with the sales agreement, which the buyers had voluntarily entered into. Once Inca certified the expenditure, the invoices became payable and we released the money to the developer.”\\nPinnacle said it was not true that commissions or fees had been used to extract money from Angelgate, adding that “absolutely no profits have been recognised from this development”. The spokesperson added that Pinnacle had never been contacted by police, and said, “If they ever were, they would fully cooperate.”\\nConcerned buyers have highlighted a series of connections between Pinnacle and North Point Global, and a recurring pattern of events – chief among which was their deposits being released to the developer without much sign of work taking place.\\nThey point to a close network of individuals who crop up in different roles at a variety of companies, often all registered to the same address – the 2nd floor of the Edward Pavilion in Liverpool’s Albert Dock.\\nIt seems … politicians are willing to endorse any kind of project James To Kun-sun\\nNorth Point Global was founded here in 2015 by Peter McInnes, who had worked with Tony Freeman to build a series of earlier Pinnacle schemes in Chester, Canterbury and Liverpool with his construction firm PHD1, before the two parted ways. McInnes – who has lived in Dubai for the last decade – was never a director or shareholder of either North Point Global or PHD1, but was described as chairman of both firms in their press releases. He has since denied chairing either company. He quickly established a buzz around the North Point brand, launching projects from North Point Pall Mall in Liverpool, with “sky gardens” and “rooftop paddle courts”, to the Element in Old Trafford, Manchester.\\n“He’s a very dynamic personality,” says property consultant Samuel Beilin, an associate of the company, who was also a director of PHD1, and who was previously declared bankrupt in 2010, with debts of around £1m. He now represents McInnes and the North Point Global Group. “Peter McInnes is a great promoter and he was able to convince the council that he could deliver high-quality, well-designed, mixed-use schemes on an industrial scale.” Liverpool council awarded the New Chinatown site to North Point Global in 2015, over another more established developer, X1 Ltd, despite the company having only been incorporated two months earlier.\\nNorth Point Pall Mall pictured last week\\nDavid Choules was another founding director of North Point Global, and later chaired the company, while at the same time his firm Inca was employed to certify expenditure on the firm’s developments. Buyers have pointed to what they believe to be a clear conflict of interest, with the same person certifying work for funds to be released, while also standing to receive those funds.\\nChoules denies any conflict and says he has been open and transparent at all times and that his colleague handled the day-to-day certification of works. He says he resigned from North Point Global in July 2016 “to avoid any perceived conflicts.”\\nJailed gangsters\\nOff-plan sales boomed and it all seemed to be going well, until Peter McInnes made headlines in March 2017, when his name was referred to in a court case about a notorious pair of jailed Liverpool gangsters, Stephen and Peter Clarke, in a hearing at Preston Crown Court. “He fronts companies, runs them until accounts are due and then scraps them and then moves on,” said DC Duncan Watson, financial investigator for the Cumbria constabulary, said of McInnes, adding that he didn’t know how someone like this “could be taken on by a council”.\\nMcInnes has fiercely denied the claims, saying he had not been represented in court to respond to the allegations, and that he had never been arrested, questioned or charged over money laundering in relation to any matter. Beilin bats away the accusations of criminal behaviour, but says such associations shouldn’t be surprising: “Liverpool is a small place. Behind every developer there’s a former relationship, friendship or businesses agreement with someone who isn’t totally savoury.”\\nI do feel sorry for them. But if a Romanian property roadshow came to the UK, I would not buy an off-plan apartment Sam Beilin of North Point Global\\n“The council is often attracted to partners who they think will be beneficial to them in the short term,” he adds, “but who turn out not to do them any favours in the long run. They really thought McInnes could deliver, but perhaps they didn’t do as much due diligence as they could have done in investigating the financial capacity of North Point Global.”\\nLiverpool City Council insists that proper due diligence was undertaken and that the developer was chosen on the basis of the ability to conclude a commercial deal in a timely fashion, the quality of the scheme submitted, and evidence of a wider strategy for the regeneration of the Chinatown area.\\nOnce buyers’ deposits had been secured, the New Chinatown project quickly began to unravel. As with Angelgate, it turned out that PHD1 had grossly undervalued the construction costs of the ambitious designs. The firm went into administration in April 2016, with debts of over £14m, including £7.8m owed to subcontractors. The building work on North Point Global’s sites was then taken on by the BILT group, which had been established just two months earlier. All the BILT firms went into liquidation one year after they were formed, with combined debts of £1.8m. Subcontractors told Construction Enquirer that they were not paid for their work.\\nIn July 2017, North Point Global announced it was halting work entirely and would seek to dispose of all of its sites, blaming the situation on adverse media coverage and the behaviour of the Liverpool City Council, which had publicly stated that it had reported the developer to the National Crime Agency. A spokesman for North Point Global said in a statement: “It would be wholly unrealistic to return to site on any of their projects as they consider that the brand has become tainted and damaged beyond salvage.” They insist that the company has never been contacted by the NCA or any other law enforcement agency.\\nMost of its building sites have stood untouched for 18 months, the concrete frames and exposed foundations standing as rotting monuments to the developer’s greed, investors’ naivety and mayoral hubris. The Banksy murals, including the 12-metre high Liverpool Rat and Love Plane, which were promised to return to public display, have been sold for £3.2m to an anonymous buyer in Qatar.\\nAfter months of uncertainty, it was announced this week that the New Chinatown site will be taken on by a new developer, which plans to resume work by the summer. “Our funding model will also be significantly different,” says Neal Hunter of Great George Street Developments. “We are engaging with major institutional investors to fund the scheme, rather than being reliant on multiple small investors.”\\nThe other sites will be sold, with “whatever money left divided back pro-rata to the buyers,” says Beilin. Given the number of creditors queuing up, to whom North Point Global owes almost £4.2m, the chances of investors seeing their money back are slim.\\n“I do feel sorry for them,” Beilin adds. “Whenever there’s a failure, there’s always a tendency to look for someone to take responsibility. But, when the buyers signed those sales contracts, I don’t think they actually understood what they were signing.”\\nHe adds bluntly: “If a Romanian property roadshow came to the UK, I would not buy a fractional off-plan apartment and if I did I would not pay more than a nominal deposit until it was built.”\\nThe victims\\nSitting in a cafe in Hong Kong’s Causeway Bay, one Baltic House buyer recalls the extravagant events where North Point Global’s projects were unveiled with dazzling models and presentations about Liverpool’s booming economy.\\n“We were wined and dined, and taken for celebratory banquets with Peter McInnes and Gary Millar,” says Mr Cheung. “It was presented as a council-backed project, and we were told it was a low-risk investment.” At the first promotional roadshow, Cheung was convinced to buy three units in Baltic House, followed by another three a month later. One year on, he was persuaded by promises of ever-higher yields to buy six more. “They even funded travel costs for us to come and see the site in Liverpool, so it all felt legitimate,” he says.\\nPromises v reality: how the schemes were sold – and what they look like now Read more\\nOne Hong Kong sales agent who was involved in promoting New Chinatown, before his company withdrew from the deal over unpaid fees, recalls the lavish roadshows. “Every few months they would turn up in Hong Kong and have a big yeehaw blow-out to say thank you to the buyers,” he says.\\nAcross town, another buyer tells how he remortgaged his home in Hong Kong in order to invest in three units in New Chinatown, Baltic House and the Element in Manchester, paying 80% upfront. “Gary Millar told us these were big, important projects for the whole country, that’s why I was convinced to go for it,” says Mr Chan, who had retired but is now looking for work again. “I loved the British system, but this experience has changed my opinion.”\\nIf you have been affected by the development schemes described and would like to pass on information in confidence, you can send a message via the Guardian’s SecureDrop service (see how here).\\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

President Hashim Thaci has two weeks in which to approve or reject the nomination.\\nAccording to Serbia’s court records, Laban, who has a law degree, was sentenced in 2011 to six years in jail for corruption as an official of the Serbian Customs. He had already served half his sentence in pre-trial detention between 2006 and 2009.\\nAfter the trial, Laban was provisionally released until he was called to serve the rest of his sentence, but instead he fled to neighboring Kosovo. Last year, a Serbian court in the town of Kraljevo issued an arrest warrant demanding he be handed back to Serbia.\\nLaban was nominated for the post by the Serb List party that represents the around five percent of Kosovo Serbs and which is controlled by Belgrade. Serbia refuses to recognize Pristina’s 2008 declaration of independence.\\n“Unfortunately, Kosovo has become a country which rehabilitates criminals into the most important constitutional institutions,” Albulena Haxhiu of the opposition party Vetevendosje wrote on Facebook.\\n“This person should not be appointed a judge of the constitutional court.”\\n“Any judge of this court should have no criminal past and no one should be appointed if he or she can be blackmailed,” Ehat Miftaraj from the Kosovo Institute for Justice, a non-governmental organization, told Reuters.\\n“The president should review this decision and act based on the law.”\\nThe background of the candidates for judges is checked by Kosovo law enforcement agencies, but Laban’s case will be difficult to solve because of Serbia’s refusal to cooperate with authorities in Pristina.\\nLaw enforcement agencies of Kosovo and Serbia communicate only through European Union bodies in both countries.\\nEULEX, a EU law and police mission in Kosovo, said it did not have the competency to extradite Laban under its current mandate and had told this to the Kraljevo court in Serbia.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Another seven items, Jones added, were deemed “Highly Personal.”\\nJones’s report covers only a small part of the materials seized in April from Cohen, which includes more than a dozen mobile devices and 19 other digital-media devices. Todd Harrison, a lawyer for Cohen, told the court last week that his firm had received about 3.7 million files, with about 1.3 million already turned over to Jones for her review.\\nIn a report filed last week, Jones said the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York had received its first batch of the information, including nearly 300,000 “items.” Her report did not specify what an “item” was – though it’s likely to include a photo, video file or email message.\\nJones, a former U.S. District Court judge in Manhattan, was appointed in April to lead the review process of the FBI-seized materials after lawyers for Cohen, Trump and the Trump Organization demanded the court ensure any legally privileged attorney-client communications didn’t end up in the hands of federal prosecutors who are examining Cohen’s business affairs.\\nThat investigation, being led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York, encompasses potential fraud charges against Cohen, as well as examining his role in arranging a $130,000 payment before the 2016 presidential election to the adult-film actress Stormy Daniels to get her to remain silent about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

We also know that on many occasions, these women were in care themselves as children. Approximately one in four birth mothers in family court proceedings will reappear with a subsequent child, and recent research suggests 58% of these mothers will have experienced sexual abuse.\\n\\u200bThe young mothers trapped in a cycle of having babies removed Read more\\nBut we also know that nearly half of women in this predicament can, at a later stage, care for a child appropriately. Improvements in their mental health and growing maturity can enable them to become successful carers. So could the whole painful process of having a child removed have been avoided?\\nAs our family courts have contracted through the age of austerity and the number of care proceedings has increased by 27% over the last four years, the system is failing to cope.\\nThe arithmetic is scary too. The average cost of a looked-after child in my borough is £57,000 per year. If the average length of care is 3.6 years, this means that the cost of each child in care is more than £200,000. Where children are long-term fostered or adopted, the costs are more than triple that figure.\\nAcross the country, grant-funded schemes are trying to break this cycle; so-called Pause programmes support women who may become recurrent mothers, or care leavers who become pregnant and may be in danger of losing their child. Some schemes encourage women to take long lasting contraception. I have mixed feelings about the use of long lasting contraception contraception with women in these circumstances.\\nWe teach techniques to support their parenting – and other approaches to deal with mental health issues and drug abuse\\nIn Calderdale, we’re running a Positive Choices programme to support families. Unqualified family support workers, supervised by a social worker, are assigned to vulnerable women who are pregnant and at risk of having a child removed. They are shown techniques to support their parenting and other approaches to deal with mental health issues and drug abuse. Support is also given where there is or has been domestic violence in the household. After one year, we have helped nine women. Two cases have failed, with the children now in care, but seven have apparently been successful; the children are safe and not in need of removal to protect them.\\nRecently I had the opportunity to talk to some of the women involved in the programme to ask them what had worked for them.\\nThe first (and possibly most remarkable) thing was that the young women were with their children at the meeting – and although they were engaged in a focused conversation with me, they gave their children almost continuous attention and eye contact. These mothers all came from challenging backgrounds: mental health problems, domestic violence and drug and alcohol abuse dominated their histories, but they were all prepared to describe their previous lifestyles – and they had clearly faced up to and understood their demons.\\nThey all described being taught to look at the impact of their behaviour – their previous negative behaviour and their now positive behaviour – and the impact they had on their child’s development. They had ameliorated their behaviour and developed empathy with their child, understanding how their actions affected emotional wellbeing. For some, there was no way to mimic their own parents’ positive parenting traits as such influences had been absent from their childhoods.\\nCan new partnership keep vulnerable children out of care? Read more\\nI was humbled by their descriptions of the family support input from the programme: two pre-arranged visits each week plus one unannounced visit to their home, sometimes at the most unexpected times. The women seemed to accept this intrusion into their lives on the grounds that their children come first. Putting up with a little inconvenience to confirm the quality of their parenting seemed like a small price to pay.\\nA fair, firm and caring relationship between the woman and their key worker was also important. I heard of staff who were prepared to drop everything and call in when challenges arose, sometimes during evenings, weekends, annual leave and even during maternity leave. Visits, texts and calls were always possible and were massively appreciated.\\nThe Positive Choices programme probably costs the public about £12,000 per case per year, so is proving to reduce costs when it is successful. And if we can manage to keep breaking the cycle of mothers having children taken into care, the human benefits will be immeasurable.\\nStuart Smith is adults and children’s services director in Calderdale and board member with Cafcass\\nJoin the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

The Post, citing four people familiar with the conversation, said the encounter quickly turned tense after the lawyers said Trump had no legal obligation to meet with the special counsel. Mueller then suggested he could issue a subpoena that would compel the president to appear before a grand jury.\\n“This isn’t some game,” John Dowd, Trump’s former lead attorney, replied. “You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States.”\\nDowd later confirmed the encounter and his comments to Reuters.\\nThe special counsel’s office has been negotiating the terms of any sit-down with Trump and his legal team amid the president’s own public assertions that he was “looking forward” to the interview.

That is, until they consider the potential side effects of using public sector muscle to rein in the pharmaceutical industry.\\nA new POLITICO-Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health poll finds that Republicans and Democrats alike overwhelmingly support the idea of drastic government action on drug prices — with 9 out of 10 in favor of handing Medicare the power to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers.\\nStory Continued Below\\nBut that bipartisan enthusiasm falters when Americans are confronted with the negative trade-offs tied to forcing prices lower, a finding that helps explain why lawmakers may have an easier time railing against skyrocketing drug prices than actually doing anything about them.\\n“This only suggests that this is a tempting issue for political people in both parties because it’s so popular,” said Robert Blendon, a Harvard professor of health policy and political analysis who designed the poll. “They’re going to find it much more controversial if they can’t answer the question of how you protect consumers from the potential downside.”\\nSupport for Medicare negotiations with drug-makers, for example, dropped from 90 percent to just 42 percent when respondents weighed the risk that some pharmaceutical companies might respond by halting the sale of certain drugs to seniors. And while 80 percent favored limiting the price of drugs sold to state health programs, only 38 percent still liked the idea if it meant drug companies would spend less on research and development.\\nThose views were largely uniform across the political spectrum, reflecting the growing pressure on Washington to tackle drug prices. But it also shows the potency of the deep-pocketed pharmaceutical industry\\'s arguments against government intervention.\\n“The industry is not going to do it because the industry is out to make money,” said Wendi Games, a New York Democrat who participated in the poll, of the need to tamp down drug prices. “It has to be a federal law, where the government gets involved.”\\nPresident Donald Trump has vowed to go after pharmaceutical companies he’s accused of “getting away with murder,” at one point siding with Democrats in favoring direct negotiating power for Medicare. However, his administration has backed off the idea, and is instead pushing for incremental changes aimed at creating more competition among drug companies and lowering patients\\' out-of-pocket costs.\\nBeyond drug pricing, the POLITICO-Harvard poll suggests the Trump administration could still find public traction in expanding access to experimental medicines for very sick patients.\\nNearly 70 percent of Americans — with similar levels of support across party lines — like the idea of letting terminally ill patients seek new drugs that haven’t been fully tested, even after considering it could hurt patients or undermine the development of new drugs.\\n“It’s not going to harm them any worse than they already are,” said Nancy Fillip, an Illinois nurse and Republican who participated in the poll. \"I can tell you that I would do anything for my patient to get better, and if a drug might make somebody live six months longer, that’s six months their family has.”\\nHowever, the poll didn’t ask specifically about the “right-to-try” legislation Trump endorsed earlier this year and that failed in a House vote on Tuesday. Opponents of the measure point out that FDA already allows patients access to experimental medicines with its approval; the right-to-try bill, however, would let patients bypass the agency.\\nDespite bipartisan agreement on pharmaceutical issues, Americans remain deeply divided on Obamacare after a year of GOP efforts to repeal the law.\\nHalf said the health care law is working about the same as a year ago, compared with 31 percent who believe it’s deteriorated and just 12 percent who think it has improved on the Trump administration’s watch.\\nAmong those who believe the law is worsening, Republicans disproportionately blame congressional Democrats, while Democrats blame Trump and Republicans. Independents, meanwhile, spread the blame around a little more evenly, though most blame congressional Democrats.\\nEven though congressional Republicans managed to effectively wipe out the unpopular individual mandate, it hasn’t translated to warmer feelings about the law among the party’s voters. Half of Republicans said Obamacare is actually working worse than a year ago, versus just 10 percent of Democrats and one-third of independents.\\n“It’s a mess,” said Fillip, the Illinois nurse, who blamed Democrats and hard-line conservatives for the GOP’s failure last year to repeal and replace the law. “Nobody would come together, and that’s what makes me so mad about Congress.”\\nThe few changes Republicans have made, such as wiping out the mandate penalty or pushing cheaper alternatives to Obamacare plans, haven’t yet pierced the public’s consciousness, Blendon said.\\nMuch of the GOP rhetoric of the past year centered on repealing Obamacare entirely in order to stave off an insurance market collapse. That’s made it difficult now for Republicans to alter individual parts of Obamacare and convince voters those smaller victories will make a huge difference.\\n“A large share of people really either are now aware of them or don’t think these changes are having much of an impact,” Blendon said. “Looking back at their last year, they don’t see big changes.”\\nThis article tagged under: Health Care\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Puzzled by the claim that biology is imaginary yet feelings are concrete?\\nIf so, then you truly are on the path to wisdom, says Ryan Anderson, the level-headed analyst of transgender theology at the Heritage Foundation, and the author of a new book on transgender politics, titled “When Harry Became Sally.”\\nHe sketches the slippery creativity of the transgender ideology in an article, titled “Transgender Ideology Is Riddled With Contradictions. Here Are the Big Ones.” He writes:\\nAt the core of the ideology is the radical claim that feelings determine reality. From this idea come extreme demands for society to play along with subjective reality claims. Trans ideologues ignore contrary evidence and competing interests, they disparage alternative practices, and they aim to muffle skeptical voices and shut down any disagreement. The movement has to keep patching and shoring up its beliefs, policing the faithful, coercing the heretics, and punishing apostates, because as soon as its furious efforts flag for a moment or someone successfully stands up to it, the whole charade is exposed. That’s what happens when your dogmas are so contrary to obvious, basic, everyday truths. A transgender future is not the “right side of history,” yet activists have convinced the most powerful sectors of our society to acquiesce to their demands. While the claims they make are manifestly false, it will take real work to prevent the spread of these harmful ideas.\\nRead it all here.\\nThere are very few “transgender” people. For example, advocates say from 250 to several thousand people in the military are trying to live like members of the other sex in a military population of 1.3 million full-time soldiers, sailors, marines and air force personnel. Fewer than o.3 percent of Americans wish to live as members of the opposite sex.\\nPolls show that roughly one-quarter of Americans support the progressive claim that biological sex trumps chosen “gender identity,” despite intense media pressure in favor of the pro-transgender, anti-sexes campaign.\\nThe progressive push to bend Americans’ attitudes and their two-sex civic society around the idea of “gender” has already attacked and cracked popular social rules for how Americans handle the many social preferences of equal, different and complementary men and women, boys and girls.\\nFor example, the gender claims have shifted rules or practices about different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents’ rights in childrearing, practices to help teenagers, women’s expectations of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men’s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, and children’s sexual privacy.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

I can\\'t afford f****** health insurance.\"\\nThat\\'s one of the first things Larry Cagle says on the phone. He is spitting nails. The Tulsa English teacher is one of the leaders of a grassroots organizing group, Oklahoma Teachers United, that they say represents thousands of public school teachers around the state. His group, and both of Oklahoma\\'s teachers unions, support the walkout and rally happening across the state Monday in support of higher wages and more state revenue.\\nTeachers are striking even though state legislators passed a pay raise of about $6,000 last week. That vote followed earlier walkouts. The bill, if signed, would bring Oklahoma\\'s teacher salaries from among the lowest in the nation, to the middle of the pack.\\nThe Oklahoma teachers are not the only ones unhappy. Teachers in Kentucky are gathering Monday at the state capitol to press for education funding. Many schools there are on spring break, allowing teachers to travel to Frankfort. Schools not on spring break closed.\\nThis wave of teacher-led actions around the country was kicked off when teachers in West Virginia emerged victorious from a nearly two-week strike earlier this month. In Arizona, hundreds of teachers walked out last week, and there have been rumbles as far away as New Mexico and Alaska.\\nThe rally in Kentucky is led by the Kentucky Education Association, the state\\'s union affiliate. But in many other states, grassroots teachers groups, like Larry Cagle\\'s group in Oklahoma, have taken the lead — often using social media to organize.\\nArizona Educators United, a grassroots group similar to Oklahoma Teachers United, has taken the helm in that state. The union affiliate, the Arizona Education Association, has offered its full support of protest efforts. \"They\\'ve really let us drive this and steer this,\" explains Noah Karvelis, one of the organizers of Arizona Educators United.\\nIn Oklahoma, teachers like Cagle have stepped up, discontent with union leadership. Oklahoma is a right-to-work state, which means that employees don\\'t have to join the unions there. The American Federation of Teachers has about 2,700 members out of 42,000 teachers. The state\\'s other major union, the Oklahoma Education Association, says it has 40,000 members including many different kinds of school employees like bus drivers, retired teachers and education majors at Oklahoma colleges and universities.\\nThat\\'s a major reason that Cagle calls the unions \"weak and vulnerable.\" He says his group has been forced to take matters into their own hands. \"We are the only unified protest group,\" he says. Teachers represented by Cagle\\'s group want a $10,000 raise. \"We had 70 percent turnover in the last five years in my school,\" he says. \"You\\'re not going to stop that with a $6,000 raise.\"\\nIf they don\\'t get what they want, he threatens continuing protests into the summer and beyond.\\nThey\\'re also in it for the long-haul, advocating for a tax change to help pay for school funding that will be on the ballot in November.\\nEd Allen, the leader of the Oklahoma City AFT, tells NPR he\\'s never seen anything like this negotiation process in his 26 years with the union. \"Never have I ever thought\" that he\\'d be negotiating with lawmakers on the one side and teachers on the other, he says. \"How do you negotiate with Facebook?\"\\n\"We consider it a down payment,\" he said in a statement last week when his union accepted the budget deal. It\\'s a nuanced position. He tells NPR that despite the \"passionate\" voices of those on social media, \"We don\\'t see any way of getting any more money.\"\\nThat\\'s not enough, says Brendan Jarvis, a middle school geography teacher just outside of Tulsa: \"[Legislators] are not talking about anything right now that teachers are happy with.\" He\\'s a board member of the Oklahoma Education Association, the state\\'s biggest teachers union. The OEA didn\\'t accept the deal.\\nJarvis says he and other OEA members are walking out — and they\\'re planning on staying out, until a plan is passed that teachers are happy with.

She\\'s attending the rally in the capitol with many of her colleagues.\\nArizona teachers are watching\\nWhen the Oklahoma senate voted last week to increase teacher pay, thousands of Arizona teachers gathered in Phoenix at the capitol. Many wore buttons that read: I don\\'t want to strike, but I will.\\nNoah Karvelis, one of the grassroots organizers of Arizona Educators United, says they want teacher pay increased by 20 percent and state education funding restored to 2008 levels. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said that won\\'t happen.\\nKarvelis, a music teacher in Tolleson, Ariz., noticed the lack of funding right away when he arrived in the state to teach two years ago.\\n\"There were days when I had more kids than chairs,\" he told NPR. Today, he has seven working keyboards to teach about 40 kids how to play piano. \"Every single kid that I\\'ve ever had deserves more than this. There are kids who are not being given a fair chance here.\"\\nKarvelis says that, once a critical mass of teachers is on board with a walkout, \"the power is in our hands.\"\\nTeachers in Arizona don\\'t have a specific legislative deadline, or a date for a walkout.

How long can dogged Theresa May keep her job? And when will the pinstriped assassin Jacob Rees-Mogg strike next? Grab another drink, slap on the Soltan, and all shall be revealed on page 194. What larks! Yet away from parliament, and far from the tabloid front pages, a serious breach is opening up in British politics. Last week some of the most senior business leaders in Britain came out of a Brexit meeting at No 10, and promptly tore the prime minister to shreds. “We’re playing economics; [the politicians] are playing politics,” said Paul Drechsler, president of the bosses’ organisation, the Confederation of British Industry. “In the world of business, we’re frustrated. We’re angry.”\\nAn extraordinary statement, especially from an executive invited to tea and biscuits with May. If supposedly tame industrialists now talk like this, you have to wonder what sounds come out of the feral lot.\\nYet the CBI’s impatience is shared by many. Once the long-haul arm of the Tory movement, the Freight Transport Association lashed out at May last week for “playing chicken with crucial parts of the British economy and the livelihoods of … 7 million Britons”.\\nThese are close friends of the Conservative party.As one senior representative of a leading business organisation says: “Over the past two years, most company bosses would never risk saying openly that Brexit is turning out to be a disaster, in case it scared off their best staff.” With fewer than 290 days before Britain formally leaves the EU, their caution is running out.\\nThis is a far bigger story than the one on the front pages about who promised which amendment to which band of Tories. One of the fundamental relationships in the establishment is fracturing – and the consequences for government and economy could prove to be historic.\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest ‘We’re angry …’ CBI president Paul Drechsler (left) and other business leaders in Downing St last November. Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images\\nAn iron rule of British politics is that the Conservatives mean business, and business means the Conservatives. Despite an early falling-out with Margaret Thatcher and a dalliance with Tony Blair, blue remains home corner for commercial companies and champions of cutting taxes and trimming red tape to a minimum. Yet in May’s two years as prime minister, business has either been cast as the enemy or relegated to a walk-on part. In that chaotic summer of 2016, as senior Tories stabbed each other in the back and themselves in the front, May was quick to grasp that many leave voters were sticking up two fingers at the British way of doing capitalism. Neither an ex-banker nor marinaded in Treasury culture, she happily blasted “unscrupulous bosses” and “corporate irresponsibility”. Among her aides was the enthusiastic leaver, Nick Timothy, whose masterplan was to use Brexit to win over working-class voters who had been chucked overboard by New Labour.\\nOnce in No 10, May’s schemes for putting workers on company boards and blocking Chinese funding of British nuclear plants turned to dust. Yet on the central policy issue of our time, business remains stuck in a non-speaking role.\\nQuick guide What is the EU withdrawal bill? Show Hide What is the EU withdrawal bill? The EU Withdrawal Bill – once known as the Great Repeal Bill – is going through the House of Commons to repeal the 1972 European Communities Act and transpose all existing EU legislation into domestic UK law, which will avoid a \\'cliff-edge\\' change on the day after we leave the EU. Parts of the bill have been highly controversial, and MPs have tabled hundreds of amendments to try and change its wording, including a significant number of Conservative rebels. Some of the key controversies include its use of so-called Henry VIII powers, which will give government ministers the power to tweak the wording of laws to make sure they make sense in UK legislation - but those changes could take place without having to go through parliament. MPs have called this a \"power grab\" by the government. The government estimates around 800 to 1,000 measures called statutory instruments will be required to make sure the bill is applied correctly. Other concerns include the government\\'s decision not to include the EU charter of fundamental rights in the law being transposed. Other amendments are attempts to affect the Brexit process, including legislating for a transitional period and giving MPs a binding meaningful vote on the deal secured by Theresa May, before the deal is finalised.\\nTake the all-important triggering of article 50: May announced it in her first conference speech as leader, just weeks after the referendum vote and before parliament had resumed. Forget about consulting industry and finance: she didn’t even give them notice.\\nAfter last summer’s election debacle, and Timothy’s exit, May’s new team set up a conciliatory business advisory council that meets in Downing Street every three months or so. A long way short of the Brexit business task force called for by the CBI and others, its rotating membership – one month WPP, the next Rolls-Royce – makes it almost useless as a forum for formal input. Unsurprisingly, it was after one of these council meetings that Drechsler exploded.\\nMinisters and aides try to calm the waters. Their efforts, while appreciated by people in business I have spoken to, are rendered void against the bungling and botching that marks the negotiations. The tens of billions taxpayers give business in subsidies and tax reliefs are now taken for granted. For as long as Brexit is treated by May first and foremost as a way to keep her own cabinet and party together, the private sector will remain frozen out. Anything else it would like – from a third runway at Heathrow to a proper industrial strategy – gets parked on the long list marked “any other business”.\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Cameron visits Jaguar Land Rover in Solihull, June 2016. Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images\\nImagine you are a senior manager at a major carmaker. Over the past two years, you have been assured that you would continue to “operate within” the European single market. Except that turned into “frictionless” trade – which then became “as frictionless as possible”. Meanwhile, the cabinet dreams up “customs partnerships” and other unicorns destined only to be waved away by Michel Barnier – and Boris Johnson is wittering on about yet another bloody bridge. How are you meant to plan around any of that? The answer is that the worst-case scenarios your team drew up in 2016 are, by 2018, your base case.\\nNo longer is it just banks and pharmaceutical firms looking overseas. Britain’s biggest car manufacturer, Jaguar Land Rover, warned this week it would shift production of its Discovery 4x4 from Solihull to EU member Slovakia. That can be explained away as focusing Midlands staff on making electric cars – but just last September, the firm said its presence in Slovakia was a “hedge” against Brexit uncertainty.\\nBusiness must speak up, and save Britain from Brexit | Polly Toynbee Read more\\nThe problem this poses for the rest of us is very real and very easy to sum up. Among all the 28 members of the EU, the UK ranks second only to Ireland on its level of inward investment. As Kevin Farnsworth at the University of York points out, from Thatcher onwards, British governments have touted for capital investment from abroad. It’s why George Osborne cut corporation tax so low and went on tours of China and India. It’s also why the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, says the UK relies on “the kindness of strangers”. That dependence has grown as Britain has lost more and more of its own businesses and become instead a branch-plant economy for the rest of the world. And that kindness is now being strained by a blundering Brexit. Soon the headlines will be not just about a few hundred jobs moving out of the City – but of firms scrapping their expansion plans, or factories shifting to Poland, or thousands of jobs going at a stroke of a pen.\\nIt was always a rotten and unsafe model. The irony is, it is a Conservative government that now appears intent on tearing it down – with nothing to replace it. In place of a strategy, you get the panic that broke out in Downing Street when Nissan threatened to take its money elsewhere – resulting in a private meeting with the Japanese carmaker and a series of promises made in a secret “comfort letter”. This is no more an economic policy than a bunch of flowers bought at a service station is a Valentine’s present.\\nBut then, this has been the decade in which the political and policymaking elite has inflicted upon itself wound after wound. First came the fiasco of austerity, and an economy that refused to bounce back as Osborne and Carney promised it would. Then came the Brexit referendum that Cameron claimed he had in the bag. And that has produced the slow dissolution of the Tory-corporate coalition central to contemporary British capitalism.\\nWith all that as the background, why wouldn’t you opt for a bit of beach-reading escapism?\\n• Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist and senior economics commentator\\n\\n### Response:\\nThere are no explicit causal chains mentioned in the given text.\\n\\n### End', 'Below is an excerpt from a news article.

Syrian state television claimed that early Monday morning that airstrikes targeted an air base in Homs , a strategic staging ground for Russian and Syrian forces. The Pentagon said it wasn\\'t involved in any strikes in Syria, and Russia says the Israelis sent two F-15 fighter jets into Syrian airspace and launched eight missiles at the T-4 air base. The Russian Defense Ministry claims \"Syrian air defense units\" shot down five of the guided missiles.\\nThe US President may find it problematic to deliver consequences in a conflict he has worked to shed any responsibility for. Last week, while he told the world he wanted to withdraw American troops from northern Syria , the three world leaders largely behind Assad\\'s survival met to discuss the way forward as they saw it. There was no American presence as the leaders of Turkey, Iran and Russia met , and no indication that the US would be included in discussions in the future.\\nThere appeared to be little the President could actually do. On Sunday, he took to Twitter to shift the blame for the events in Syria to his predecessor, Barack Obama.\\n\"If President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line In The Sand, the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago! Animal Assad would have been history!\" Trump posted on Twitter\\n\"OK, Barack Obama made some mistakes,\" said Fawaz Gerges , a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. \"Is President Trump committed? Does he have the desire and the will to basically become engaged in Syria? This is the question,\" he told CNN.\\nUnilaterally forfeiting American influence\\nTrump came into office determined to undo many of Obama\\'s policies, dissolve treaties he deemed against American interests and eager to avoid being drawn into conflicts abroad that he\\'d argued were costly and unnecessary.\\nBut months in, Trump authorized his own military strike against a Syrian government air base after a chemical weapons attack killed dozens of civilians earlier in the city of Khan Sheikhoun. US warships launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at the base that was headquarters for the warplanes that carried out the chemical attacks.\\nTrump\\'s decision at the time was viewed as a dramatic shift in his position on the presence of American troops in Syria. Footage showing \"innocent babies\" killed by chemical gas, \"crosses many, many lines. Beyond a red line, many, many lines,\" Trump said then.\\nJUST WATCHED Trump: Putin, Iran responsible for backing Assad Replay More Videos ...

He\\'s reportedly unhappy with the amount of money the US was spending in the region, and has questioned the results of that expenditure. But after tense discussions with his national security team, he\\'s agreed to hold off on ordering the withdrawal.\\nThat decision has \"unilaterally forfeited any American influence in helping shape Syria\\'s future,\" Fawaz Gerges told CNN. \"Trump\\'s fateful decision will reinforce the widespread perception, among both friends and foes of the United States, that America is in retreat in Syria and beyond, unwilling to shoulder the burden of global leadership. It is also an explicit acknowledgment that the United States and its Syrian allies have lost the war.\"\\nAn unresolvable conundrum\\nOstensibly, the United States has been in Syria for years now to battle elements of the Islamic State. Its troops had allied with Kurdish militias and other partners on the ground (in Iraq it was the Iraqi army and Shiite militias) to wrest back territory seized by the extremists across a swath of Iraq and Syria.\\nFrom early on, the Obama administration chose to distinguish its fight in Syria as focused largely against ISIS, and maintained its position regarding the Syrian regime to be in line with sanctions and pressure from the international community, but without any military leverage.\\n\"US policy toward Syria has been debilitated by an irresolvable conundrum.

America\\'s ebbing influence from the international scene has allowed Putin to assume a larger role and greater influence that he has emphasized in his ties to the Syrian regime.\\n\"Russia has history, a defense pact, and close political relations with Damascus. Iran has more recent strategic links, growing commercial interests, and controls thousands of pro-Tehran militias in addition to its own troops across the country,\" said Rodger Shanahan at the Lowy Institute in Australia. Turkey too, has commercial interests, hundreds of miles of a shared border, and hosts (under the dime of the European Union) hundreds of thousands of Syrians in its country.\\nDéjà vu at the UN\\nThere are more meetings called at the United Nations Security Council, but with the Russians ready to veto any measures that are too punitive, there\\'s likely to be little accomplished beyond more speeches from Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the international body. She tweeted on Sunday about an emergency meeting to be held Monday to discuss the \"horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians in Syria.\"\\n\"This is becoming all too common. Strong action is needed,\" she said on Twitter. But it\\'s not clear what form that strong action might take.\\nOn the Sunday talk shows, Republicans, including Sens. Lindsey Graham and John McCain, called on Trump to respond \"decisively\" to \"demonstrate that Assad will pay the price for his crimes.\"\\nJUST WATCHED Trump: I want to get out of Syria Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: I want to get out of Syria 02:09\\nOne way Trump could punish Syria would be to press Iran\\'s trading partners to exert economic pressure on Iran to curtail its ability to provide Syria with military support, but there\\'s a catch, say Hokayem and Sadjadpour.\\n\"Persuading US allies to do more to counter Iran\\'s destructive regional policies will require continued US adherence to the JCPOA (the Iran nuclear deal) -- a worthy trade-off,\" they write. \"Washington should simultaneously continue to expose the high costs of Iran\\'s regional policies ... at a time of growing economic and political discontent in Iran.\"\\nBut Trump opposes the deal with Iran. In January, he said it was the last time he was issuing a waiver denoting that Iran was complying with the agreement. He said he was doing so \"only in order to secure our European allies\\' agreement to fix the terrible flaws\" of the deal. He warned the US would not \"again waive sanctions in order to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. If at any time I judge that such an agreement is not within reach, I will withdraw from the deal immediately.\"\\n\"With President Trump\\'s nearing his decision on the nuclear agreement with Iran, there is a real and present danger that Syria will become the battleground for an even more dangerous conflagration than the war that is continuing on its torturous route,\" noted the LSE\\'s Fawaz Gerges.\\nJUST WATCHED Two years of Trump panning the Iran deal Replay More Videos ...

Last week sanctions were finally announced against Russian individuals , troll farms and intelligence agencies.\\nA lack of strategic levers\\nThere was little follow up from Trump after he ordered the military airstrikes on Syria in April 2017. Before he was unceremoniously dismissed, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that US troops would leave Syria based on conditions on the ground , and not an aribitrary timeline.\\n\"From a negotiator\\'s viewpoint, the lack of a timeline is good, but only if the parties you\\'re dealing with know you have significant leverage to exert.

President Donald Trump has proposed tariffs on aerospace, machinery, and information and communications technology products imported from China. Beijing swiftly replied with its own tariffs on U.S. fruits, wine, steel pipe and pork, among other goods.\\nHere at home, some industries are particularly at risk. That\\'s because companies in these sectors not only import parts and materials from China, but also often export finished products there as well.\\nThere are three primary mechanisms by which U.S. tariffs on China could hurt American companies. Tariffs on Chinese imports would increase the cost of raw materials for U.S. businesses, forcing them to pay more to make the same goods, whether cars, appliances or electronics. China\\'s reciprocal tariffs make U.S. goods more expensive for Chinese consumers, hurting the many businesses trying their luck in the world\\'s largest market.\\nFinally, China could make it hard for American companies to do business using other methods, such as increasing regulations on U.S. companies in China or slowing down deals.\\n\"The retaliation could turn into dissuading Chinese consumers and Chinese businesses from buying U.S. products and brands,\" Keith Parker, a strategist at UBS, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There\\'s lots of things that can be done, if trade tensions were to escalate, whether it\\'s influencing purchasing decisions or making exports to the U.S. more difficult.\"\\nTechnology and electronics\\nU.S. technology companies rank particularly high on the list of potential losers because many of them are exposed in multiple ways: They rely on Chinese suppliers, and they sell to Chinese companies. UBS, which compiled a list of public companies with significant sales in China, noted that cell phones, computer equipment, semiconductors and clothing were potentially the most vulnerable products if Beijing chooses to hit back.\\n\"All iPhones come out of China,\" said Jeff Fieldhack, an analyst at Counterpoint Research. \"And other U.S. companies, even if their R&D and development is here in the U.S., they\\'re still making their parts and assembly in China.\"\\nApple (AAPL) is exposed to China in several ways: It relies on Chinese factories for assembly; China has an effective lock on the rare-earth minerals essential for Apple products; and China\\'s fast-growing middle class is increasingly important for Apple\\'s consumer strategy. Some 20 percent of Apple\\'s sales last year were in China.\\n\"China is the biggest market to over 100 countries. It\\'s hard to find another country with that kind of demand,\" said Ann Lee, a former professor at Peking University and author of \"Why China\\'s Economy Collapsed.\" \"If the U.S. goes forward, you could see blowback that could hurt companies and workers.\"\\nBoeing\\nBoeing (BA) stock, which plunged when the U.S. announced steel and aluminum tariffs in February, continued to drop Wednesday, reflecting the company\\'s vulnerability to international tensions.\\nChina has unique leverage because it buys so many of Boeing\\'s planes. It signed a deal to buy 300 Boeing planes during Mr. Trump\\'s fall visit to the country. Over the next two decades, China is projected to order around $1 trillion worth of aircraft, according to Bloomberg.\\nAfter the U.S., \"China is the largest market for Boeing aircraft in the world; it\\'s about 20-25 percent of aircraft deliveries every year,\" said Chris Higgins, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. \"They don\\'t really need to enact tariffs to retaliate on Boeing; all they need to do is shift purchases to Airbus.\"\\n\"If they announce a large order for Airbus aircraft tomorrow, that would send a message,\" he added.\\nA lesser risk is the rising cost of metal itself. Because aircraft are made primarily of steel and aluminum, an increase in those costs would ding its profit margins. Aluminum, which makes up nearly 80 percent of an airplane\\'s body weight, is set to get 10 percent pricier after the tariffs.\\nBut the industry is relatively used to volatile commodity prices, said Higgins -- aluminum prices rose nearly 25 percent last year with \"hardly a peep\" from the aerospace industry. (Steel, while it\\'s subject to heavier 25 percent tariffs, makes up only about 10 percent of an airplane\\'s weight.)\\nSoybeans\\nSome of the fiercest opposition to tariffs is coming from a sector that has, so far, been spared retaliation: soybeans. Soybean farmers sent $14 billion of crops to China last year and see themselves as a prime target for countermeasures.\\n\"We\\'re very concerned about the type of retaliation we might get,\" said Wayne Fredericks, who grows soybeans and corn on 750 acres in northern Iowa. \"The soybean industry is sitting in the bull\\'s eye of Chinese retaliatory efforts.\"\\nWayne Fredericks\\nChina is the biggest customer for U.S. soybeans, buying one-third of our soybean crop last year. That number, which has increased exponentially over the last 15 years, is driven by the Chinese middle class\\' growing appetite for meat. The soybeans are pressed and used for animal feed and, to a lesser degree, for cooking oil.\\n\"As income levels have risen in China, diets have shifted more and more to meat consumption,\" said Joseph Glauber, senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute. \"They\\'ve modernized their pork and poultry production, so it looks a lot like the U.S., and they feed them much like we do in the U.S.\" -- that is to say, with soybeans and corn. Sorghum and barley have also benefited from this growth to a lesser degree.\\nFor its part, China has accused the U.S. government of unfairly subsidizing the soybean industry to flood the markets (the very same tactic of which Mr. Trump accuses the Chinese.)\\n\"Certainly these issues are not new,\" said Kirk Leeds, director of business development for the Iowa Soybean Association (ISA). \"What appears to be different is the Trump administration is taking what appears to be a much more aggressive position. That makes many of us nervous.\"\\nLeeds, who is leading an ISA delegation on a two-week trip to China, spoke to CBS News from a high-speed train between Beijing and Wuhan. His group had just met with the U.S. ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, who is also Iowa\\'s former governor.\\n\"I think the next couple weeks could be critical,\" he said. \"Everyone is aware over here, everyone\\'s paying attention to us and most [people] are hoping that there will be a firm resolution.\"\\nFinancial firms\\nIn October, China loosened regulations on foreign ownership of Chinese banks, a step the U.S. finance industry lauded as historic. With the U.S. contemplating tariffs—not to mention knocking down Chinese ownership of U.S. companies—observers worry China could reverse its steps.\\n\"That was a huge offer from the Chinese, and that could completely go down the drain with these kinds of tariffs,\" said Lee. \"The Chinese will say, \\'Why should we be bending over backwards when you don\\'t want to establish a stronger relationship?\\'\"\\nIn nearly all other sectors, Chinese rules on foreign companies remain famously strict (a fact that Mr. Trump highlighted on Thursday).\\n\"U.S. companies, tech companies and high-value-add companies are in essence forced to partner with a domestic producer in China. That\\'s one area where policymakers could tighten the screws,\" said Peter Donisanu, investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo.\\nWith higher barriers to ownership, U.S. companies could conclude it\\'s easier to sell their share of an enterprise and essentially exit the Chinese market.\\nHard bargain\\nGiven the potential of tariffs to hurt hundreds of U.S. businesses, many analysts are choosing to see Thursday\\'s announcement not as the last word, but rather as an opening gambit aimed at bringing China to the bargaining table.\\n\"For now this seems to be about renegotiating trade deals,\" said Donisanu, citing the examples of steel and aluminum tariffs, which were watered down significantly before they even came into effect.\\nBut even if the final tariffs are small numerically, a prolonged negotiation between the U.S. and China could have other consequences. Decisions about supply chains, factories, hiring and firing can take years to fully play out. In the meantime, American industry has two weeks to press the case for particular tariffs—and to fret about the results.\\n\"Maybe in a few years we can look back and say, as convoluted as this strategy is, it was beneficial for the U.S.,\" said Fredericks, the soybean farmer. \"But the process is pretty painful.\"\\nJillian Harding and Rachel Layne contributed reporting.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Tom Garrett and his wife turned the congressman’s staff into personal servants, multiple former employees to the freshman Republican told POLITICO — assigning them tasks from grocery shopping to fetching the congressman’s clothes to caring for their pet dog, all during work hours.\\nPOLITICO has spoken with four former staffers who detailed a deeply dysfunctional office, where the congressman and his wife, Flanna, often demanded that staff run personal errands outside their typical congressional duties. The couple called on staff to pick up groceries, chauffeur Garrett’s daughters to and from his Virginia district, and fetch clothes that the congressman forgot at his Washington apartment. They were even expected to watch and clean up after Sophie, their Jack Russell-Pomeranian mix, the aides said.\\nStory Continued Below\\nThe staffers said they feared that if they refused Garrett‘s or his wife’s orders — both were known for explosive tempers — they would struggle to advance in their careers. It wasn't just full-time staff: many of the allegedly inappropriate requests were made of interns, the former aides said.\\n“I didn’t know who I was working for: Was I working for him? Was I working for her?” said one of those staffers who, like others interviewed for this story, asked not to be named for fear of retribution. “We became their gofers.”\\nA spokesman for Garrett, Matt Missen, declined to address a detailed list of complaints about the office.\\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\\n“We see no reason to respond to anonymous, unfounded allegations primarily targeting Congressman Garrett’s wife, made by POLITICO’s ‘unnamed’ sources,” he said. “It is easy to spread untruths and even easier to exaggerate and imply wrongdoing when none exists.”\\nThe behind-the-scenes turmoil boiled over Tuesday evening, when Garrett’s chief of staff, Jimmy Keady, abruptly parted ways with the congressman. His exit, multiple sources say, came amid a dispute with Garrett over the couple’s alleged misuse of official resources. Multiple sources raised the issue with the congressman, and senior staffers tried to rectify the situation repeatedly.\\nOn Wednesday, Garrett, a 46-year-old Army veteran and former state senator, began telling associates that he was considering not running for reelection — stunning Republicans in Virginia and Washington. But a day later, he reversed course, saying during a rambling 30-minute news conference that he would in fact seek another term.\\n“There is no way in heck that I’m not going to be back here in 2019 as a member of the Congress representing the 5th District of Virginia. Too darn much is at stake,” Garrett told reporters.\\nMuch of the controversy stemmed from Garrett’s wife, Flanna, a frequent presence in his House office. Former staffers said she comes to work with him on most weekdays.\\nEarly in his tenure, staffers say, Flanna began asking aides to perform what they considered to be tasks that were unofficial and personal in nature. One staffer recalled an instance in which he had been asked to pick her up from the grocery store, drive her to the couple’s apartment and help her unload groceries. Tom Garrett was at a baseball game and was unable to help, the staffer was told at the time.\\nGarrett also had staffers run errands for him. From time to time, two former staffers recalled, the congressman would arrive to work having forgotten to wear a belt or with a stain on his shirt, they said. Garrett, they said, would dispatch aides to his apartment to pick up fresh clothes for him.\\nAides also grew acquainted with the couple’s dog, who often came to the office with the Garretts. Staffers were expected to watch the dog during office hours, and one aide did so over a weekend. Several aides said the couple would sometimes seem to forget the dog was in the office. When that happened, at the end of the day, aides were responsible for transporting it back to Garrett’s Washington apartment.\\nOne source said the dog occasionally defecated on the floor and aides had to clean up the mess.\\nAides also served as drivers for the congressman’s older daughters from a previous marriage, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter. Interns or other staffers were sent to Scottsdale, Virginia, where the two lived in Garrett’s district, to pick them up and bring them to Washington. Scottsdale is a three-hour drive from D.C.\\nGarrett’s conduct could raise ethics concerns. The House Ethics manual prohibits lawmakers from using staff for anything other than official congressional duties. Members are explicitly barred from instructing aides to do personal errands in the manual, which also recounts situations in which staff were wrongly told to fetch personal mail, clean a member’s home and pay a member’s bills.\\nMissen said there is “no ethics investigation” into the office and that “to ensure that all staff follow the rules, Congressman Garrett has had lawyers from the House Ethics Committee meet with him and his staff (to include district staff via telephone) to brief everyone on the ethics rules pertaining to congressmen and staff, and to answer any questions.”\\nStaffer say the atmosphere in the office was toxic, however, and the demands were far outside what should reasonably be expected of congressional aides. Flanna would reach out to aides at all hours of the night, according to two former staffers. One person recalled an incident in which Flanna lashed out at a staffer for not picking up the congressman from his apartment after he overslept.\\nFormer aides said they were afraid to refuse Flanna’s instructions. Some said they performed them without protest because they worried they’d be fired.\\nOthers, however, left because they couldn’t take it anymore. Since taking office in January 2017, Garrett has had among the highest levels of turnover in the House, according to records compiled by legislative data company LegiStorm . More than 60 percent of his staff left in 2017, compared with the House’s typical 25 percent turnover rate that year, making the office fourth out of more than 400 legislative shops.\\n“I came aboard because I really, really believed in the message being presented and believed in Garrett as a person and as congressman,” said one the former aides. “I can take hard work. What I can’t put up with is these just mundane tasks that [were] being asked to be completed by him and his wife that had nothing to do with the job.”\\nThat same staffer said he told a senior aide that running the Garretts’ personal errands was “effed up.” The senior staffer responded that if he couldn’t handle it, this was not the job for him.\\nJust hours before his news conference on Thursday, Garrett decided he wanted one of his departed staffers back.\\nThat morning, he tried to hire back Keady, the former chief of staff who objected to the congressman’s use of office resources.\\nKeady declined the offer.\\nJohn Bresnahan contributed to this report.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

In those contacts, Strzok, who also helped run the investigation into Hillary Clinton\\'s use of a private email server, referred to Trump as an \"idiot\" and the two expressed a clear preference for the Democratic candidate.\\nMore: Peter Strzok, FBI agent removed from Robert Mueller\\'s Russia probe, called Trump an \\'idiot\\'\\nRelated: FBI agent assigned to Russia investigation removed after anti-Trump texts\\nIn all, Justice identified about 50,000 messages between the two.\\nIn a statement Monday, Sessions said the FBI had not retained messages between the two, from Dec.14, 2016 to May 17, 2017, the day Mueller was appointed to lead Justice\\'s inquiry into Russia interference in the 2016 election.\\nMueller\\'s appointment followed Sessions\\' decision to recuse himself from overseeing that matter because he failed to disclose pre-election meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\\nA number of congressional panels have requested the text communications between Strzok and Page to examine whether Mueller\\'s investigation was biased against Trump. The texts were first discovered this summer by the Justice Department\\'s inspector general who is in the midst of a wide-ranging review of the department\\'s handling of the Clinton investigation.\\n“The department apprised the congressional committees of the missing text messages on Friday,\" Sessions said. \"I have spoken to the inspector general and a review is already underway to ascertain what occurred and to determine if these records can be recovered in any other way. If any wrongdoing were to be found to have caused this gap, appropriate legal disciplinary action measures will be taken.\\n“We will leave no stone un-turned to confirm with certainty why these text messages are not now available to be produced and will use every technology available to determine whether the missing messages are recoverable from another source,\" Sessions said.\\nRepublican lawmakers have seized on the text communications to question the credibility of Mueller\\'s continuing inquiry and to call for a second special counsel to examine the FBI\\'s handling of the matter.\\nIn a statement Monday, the Republican chairmen of three influential House panels--the Intelligence, Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees--called the missing communications \"concerning.\"\\nThe missing messages, the chairmen said, represent a \"critical gap encompassing the FBI\\'s Russia investigation.\"\\nContributing: Erin Kelly\\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2F6vM7z\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

The nuns claimed they bought the estate in 1971, pooling together income they had earned as teachers in Los Angeles parochial schools.\\nPatrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images The former home of Sisters of the Most Holy and Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary is located in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles.\\nBut since 2015, the nuns have been involved in a heated dispute with the Archdiocese of Los Angeles over who has the right to sell the property. The archdiocese struck a deal with Perry to sell the 8-acre property for $14.5 million. Perry has reportedly said she wants to live on the property with her mother and grandmother.\\nThe Los Angeles Archdiocese claims the property was no longer suitable for the elderly women. The nuns moved out of the convent in 2011.\\n“There are a lot of stairs, and it’s a really big space as well,” Adrian Alarcon, a senior spokesperson for the archdiocese, told The Daily Beast. “A lot of the sisters now live in assisted living homes or retirement homes where they can get the proper care they need.”\\nCallanan and fellow sister Catherine Rose Holzman attempted to sell the property to a local restaurateur, Dana Hollister, for $15.5 million, according to the Los Angeles Times. Hollister reportedly wanted to turn the property into a hotel.\\nA Los Angeles County superior court judge ruled that the nuns’ sale was invalid in March 2017.\\nCanon law dictates that the sale of any property for more than $7.5 million requires the Vatican’s approval. The judge found that nuns did not receive permission from the pope, the Holy See or their local archbishop for the sale, the Los Angeles Times reports.\\nIn November, a jury decided that Hollister had intentionally interfered with the sale. The jury awarded the archdiocese $3.47 million in lawyer’s fees, while Perry’s company, Bird Nest LLC, was awarded $1.57 million in fees.\\n“I am thrilled with the outcome,” Perry’s manager, Steve Jensen, told the Los Angeles Times in November. “It just proves that we have been right all the way along.”\\nPatrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images The 8-acre property features panoramic views and Roman villa-style buildings.\\nOn March 9, Holzman collapsed and died during a post-judgment hearing related to the dispute. She was 89 years old.\\nHolzman spoke to Los Angeles station KTTV about the fight with Perry hours before her death. It would end up being her final interview.\\n“To Katy Perry, please stop. It’s not doing anyone any good except hurting a lot of people,” Holzman told the station.\\nCallanan started a GoFundMe page in October 2017 to help raise money for the legal fight. She’s raised over $38,000 so far.\\nThe nun mourned the loss of her “cherished partner” Holzman in an update she posted to the page on March 10.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Her anti-war statement, like so many that came after it, did not come without sacrifice. She was court martialled and sentenced to six months hard labour – though in the end never served her sentence.\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Susan Schnall in Vietnam. Photograph: Nina Schnall\\nSchnall is just one of the dozen of veterans who are visiting Vietnam for the opening of an exhibition that honours the almost-forgotten yet pivotal role that active duty servicemen men and women played in the anti-war movement.\\nSchnall is one of many who feature in the exhibition, held at the War Remnants museum in Vietnam’s capital Ho Chi Minh City. A picture of her leading the GI anti-war march days before she was court martialled will hang in pride of place, alongside newsletters, posters and handwritten letters and photographs, most of which have never been exhibited.\\nWhile the stereotypical image of the Vietnam anti-war protester is hippies on campus, flowers in hand, by 1968 every major demonstration was actually led by active-duty officers. Most had returned so horrified by what they had seen and done, they became the most vocal and forceful voices in the anti-war movement.\\nThe exhibition, titled Waging Peace, opens in the midst of the 50th anniversary of the Tet Offensive – a brutal turning point in the war – and will travel to Notre Dame University in the US after Vietnam.\\nWaging Peace has been curated by Ron Carver, who worked alongside active GIs and servicemen in the anti-war movement from 1968.\\nFor Carver and the GIs involved, telling this story in Vietnam was essential and at the exhibition opening on 19 March the US veterans will meet with their Vietnamese counterparts.\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Vietnam veterans demonstrate against the war outside the US Capitol on 23 April 1971. Photograph: Fred W. McDarrah/Getty Images\\nPatriotic duty, then a sense of betrayal\\nCarver helped in the network of coffeehouses, the beating heart of the anti war-movement, which were casual gathering spaces set up near army bases in the US (an estimated 300 existed across the US). Here, disaffected servicemen and army personnel would share stories of how they had become convinced the invasion was, as Carver described it, “a cruel, terrible thing,”\\n“A lot of these soldiers felt very angry,” said Carver. “Many of them had volunteered to go into the military thinking it was a patriotic and righteous thing to do, and when they went over there and saw the Vietnamese population did not want us, saw the brutality and the war crimes that our country was committing, they felt very betrayed and were highly, highly motivated to develop resistance.”\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Inside the Fort Dix Coffee House in Wrightstown, New Jersey, before it was bombed and closed. Photograph: Supplied\\nIt was not just conversation that came out of these coffeehouses. They were the hubs of the underground newspapers that proliferated during the war, filled with firsthand accounts from GIs of brutality from the frontline and telling a truth the government and the military tried to suppress. It was often a DIY operation by the GIs who would put the newspapers together by hand and then photocopy them.\\nThey form a focal part of the exhibition. It is thought there were more than 5,000 underground newspapers at the height of the anti-war movement. In San Francisco, The Ally newspaper, which came out monthly, printed up to 20,000 copies each time, and they shipped batches of 100 to the soldiers in Vietnam, where they were a core part of the discord that erupted across military bases.\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A newsletter supporting the Fort Hood Three, who in 1966 refused to follow orders and go to Vietnam.\\nThe military fought back against the coffeehouses as best it could, using police to shut down them down and punishing GIs if they were found in possession of newspapers. They were even investigated by the FBI and, in Fort Dix, the coffeehouse was bombed by vigilantes.\\nYet the army came down heaviest on those whose anti-war statements were made in public defiance of orders. Among those honoured by the exhibition are the “Fort Hood Three”, a trio of soldiers who were drafted and trained but refused to report for duty in 1966. It landed them with a court martial and a three-year jail sentence, but as newspapers and posters in the exhibition reveal, they were also made into martyrs by the GI anti-war movement.\\n“ I really began to identify with the struggle of the Vietnamese people and I began to admire them,” said JJ Johnson, one of the Fort Hood 3. “And the strength to resist grew from the knowledge. I realised, ‘to hell with them, I can’t take part in this.’ And we wanted to say it publicly so people knew this was a feeling that exists within the military.”\\nThe exhibition acknowledges that not all the sacrifices were purely public. Chuck Searcy, who worked with Carver on the exhibition, spent a year in military intelligence in Saigon in 1968 and came back vehemently against the war. He began to speak out, but was subsequently disowned by his father, a former World War Two veteran, and estranged from his family for two years.\\n“My parents were dismayed,” he said. “It was embarrassing to them. I remember my father said ‘you’re not a good American, you’re not a patriot any more.’ He said to me, ‘what happened to you over there, did they turn you into a communist?’ So many families went through that.”\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chuck Searcy today outside the land mine action centre in Vietnam. Photograph: Ron Carver\\nSchnall, Johnson and Searcy all agreed that despite the multitudes of books and documentaries on Vietnam, the role that GIs played in fighting for peace from within has always been downplayed and overlooked.\\n“People need to know that active duty soldiers at the height of the Vietnam war, in the belly of the beast, the belly of the green machine, were able to build a movement that ended up crippling the ground forces and stopped them being effective,” added Carver. “That should be an inspiration to people, and that’s what it’s all about.”\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

If a new accord could not be reached that is fairer to American workers and reduces the U.S. trade deficit, Trump said he would withdraw from the deal. The U.S. neighbors have resisted major changes, and the talks continue.\\nBoth gestures were disastrous for U.S. trade and influence, said Anders Aslund, an economist at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, which promotes trans-Atlantic relations.\\nHe said the U.S. marginalized itself from Mexico, a key partner in both trade deals. \"It also means the U.S. isolates itself from Latin America,\" Aslund added.\\nThe agreement with Pacific countries was supposed to set standards for trade, labor and the environment for East Asia under U.S. leadership. By pulling out, Trump in effect allows China to set those standards, Aslund said.\\nTrump pledged to negotiate better agreements with each country involved, but \"there are no bilateral trade deals being discussed with the United States,\" Aslund said.\\nMore: Trump makes it official: He will renegotiate NAFTA\\nProtesters sit together in an intersection in the streets of Miami, Fla., as they protest the Trump administration\\'s immigration policies on Jan. 17, 2018.

Federal courts blocked the ban, the list of countries changed, and the Supreme Court approved the latest version, which affects Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Chad, while legal challenges continue.\\nThe ban has been decried by other countries around the world.\\nHe also promised to build a wall along the southern U.S. border to keep out illegal immigrants and said Mexico would pay for it. Trump\\'s chief of staff, John Kelly, told Democratic lawmakers this week that Mexico will not pay for the wall, though Trump continues to insist it will.\\nThe Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it.

In June, Trump affirmed the U.S. commitment to aid any of the 28 NATO nations if attacked. He did so after other NATO leaders said they were prepared to maintain a collective self-defense even without American support.\\nBut the damage was done, Aslund said: \"Even when Trump eventually came out in favor of Article 5 he does not look like a reliable ally.\"\\nDespite that, Aslund said, Trump did more than the Obama administration to counter Russia\\'s threat to NATO\\'s eastern flank.\\nTrump reluctantly signed legislation last summer giving Congress sole authority over lifting the sanctions on Russia for its support of separatists in eastern Ukraine.

Trump\\'s actions, making the U.S. the lone holdout from the global accord, drew international condemnations from American allies in Europe, who ruled out new talks.\\nSince the Paris agreement was negotiated with Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Europe \"now has to deal with China on its own, and the U.S. has no influence,\" Aslund said.\\nMore: U.S. withdrawing from Paris climate agreement, Trump announces\\nA photo taken on Nov. 8, 2017, shows demonstrators holding a placard showing a picture of President Trump as they wait for his appearance outside the National Cemetery in Seoul.

After North Korea said it would fire missiles in the direction of Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific, Trump responded that \"North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” North Korea never followed through on its threat. Trump also traded unprecedented personal insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump called Kim “little rocket man\" and “a sick puppy.” Kim called Trump \"a dotard,” meaning senile.\\nA file photo taken on Nov. 8, 2017 shows demonstrators shouting slogans during a rally outside the National Assembly where President Trump was speaking, in Seoul, South Korea.

I would argue probably not,\" he said.\\n• Recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital\\nTrump’s formal recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in December angered Muslim nations and drew a rebuke at the United Nations from 128 countries. Only seven small nations joined the U.S. and Israel in voting against the U.N. resolution Dec. 21, while 35 nations abstained.\\nTrump said his decision should have no bearing on final borders to be negotiated as part of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.\\nOn Tuesday, the Trump administration withheld $65 million, more than half the amount due, from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which has supported Palestinian refugees since the 1948 Arab war that erupted when Israel was created.

This is a story we tell ourselves. There are places where no one bothers to differentiate between truth and lies; other places. Such as Russia, where there is the facade of a democratic election, but what matters is simply control of the narrative. We watch as various Russian diplomats deny any Russian connection to the poisoning of the Sergei Skripal and his daughter. We look at the US, where they have lost count of Donald Trump’s untruths. He lies as he breathes; the effect is numbing. He has told so many lies that the latest ones float by.\\nThis incessant lying wears the public down. Some Russians claim the lies that are told require a person to split into different realities, so each thing is true at the time. There is no objective truth, only versions of it. The manufacture of chaos is implicit in this deliberate destabilisation. We can locate lying within the pathology of individuals, but it requires ongoing turmoil to sustain it. Trump knows this.\\nYet this creation of pandemonium to disguise dishonesty is something we too are familiar with in the burble of Boris Johnson, foreign secretary. The evasions, the metaphors, the spluttering, the wit is, to use a Johnsonian word, a miasma – a fog to hide mendacity. Johnson is a man who has been elevated rather than held accountable for his lies. Some are big: the famed £350m a week after Brexit that we will get back. (Lying about Brussels made his name as a hack.) Some are small – if extramarital affairs and children can be described in this way. It is still astonishing to me that a man of so little credibility represents our country abroad – and especially now. Over the weekend he admitted, in a BBC interview, that he had played a tennis match in 2014 with Lubov Chernukhin, wife of Vladimir Putin’s former deputy finance minister, in return for a £160,000 donation to the Conservative party. It was a matter for the authorities not him, Johnson said, “if there is evidence of gross corruption in the way [Chernukhin] obtained his wealth”. The Tory party is relaxed about donations from oligarchs and it is obvious that Johnson is more relaxed than most, although he seemed somewhat tense defending this. Perhaps because it surely makes his position asking for a unified stance on Russia more difficult.\\nHypocrisy, though, is the least of it. Johnson just doesn’t “do” accountability. Why should he, when he simply gets promoted out of culpability?\\nThis month he was questioned about possible misconduct in public office because £46m has been spent on something that did not happen: the garden bridge. How was such a huge sum of money spent? How in 2016 was funding for construction released even though the original conditions for that money had not been met? Johnson as mayor watered down these conditions. Labour and the Lib Dems are rightly asking questions about this. Johnson said the explanation “is something which, I’m afraid, I simply don’t have, at this distance in time”. In what world is this good enough? Lawyers say a charge of public misconduct could follow if Johnson’s actions showed “reckless indifference”. A causal observer may say that this is surely Johnson’s modus operandi.\\nHow is it that someone in power can lie and cheat, we may wonder. How is fake news spread? How is disinformation used? Lying becomes simply an exercise of power. Consequences are for small people. Politics becomes simply a scripted reality show with characters. This is said of Russia, but watching Johnson, maybe these things are not so foreign to us after all.\\nIs it time to admit privacy is finished?\\nIn another life, I would not use social media. I would write long and thoughtful letters and attend polite debates. I would not get moth killer delivered by Amazon. I would never take an Uber. I would live up a tree.\\nIn this brave not particularly new world, though, all these things are linked, and I am linked through them. I may extricate myself from Facebook following the new revelations, but part of me thinks it is all too late. While, politically, of course I don’t want the engineering of elections based on the exchange of Facebook profiles, I can’t say that this feeling of being watched is novel. Or as individual that I know how to react. Once supermarkets introduced reward cards in the mid-90s, I was aware that my purchases were being tracked, but I shrugged my shoulders. It became ever more noticeable with social media that what was being advertised to me were things I had already bought. There is still this peculiar glitch in the algorithm whereby if you buy one toaster it is presumed you want another. You don’t.\\nThe cluminess of such ads acted as a reassurance. Lately, though, there is the listening by phones, and this does feel like an invasion of privacy. Many people do still want to share pictures of their cat and baby, but there is somehow a dull acceptance that the idea of privacy is now as revolutionary and far off as the world wide web once was. Only disconnect.\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jeremy Corbyn with a photoshopped hat on his head. Photograph: Finnbarr Webster Editorial / Ala/Alamy Stock Photo\\nSpare me the Corbynista gnashing of teeth\\nThe cat in the hat furore – over whether the BBC photoshopped Jeremy Corbyn’s “Lenin cap” to look more “red” in front of a Kremlin backdrop on Newsnight – is one rum do. The suggestion is that the BBC made Corbyn look like a Russian stooge and that it is never fair in its coverage of him. There may be something to this, but the gnashing of teeth from his followers did not do anything but make them look cultish and obsessive as two people lay critically ill in hospital. The idea that, until we saw him in that hat, we had no idea of his geopolitical persuasions is as strange as the idea that we have never before seen any imagery that attached him to communist propaganda. Leninism is in eye of the beholder.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Newslook\\nCuba is expected to name a new president April 19, 2018, which would mark the first time a Castro is not head of state in nearly 60 years. In this 2011 file photo, former president Fidel Castro, left, and his brother, President Raúl Castro, attend the 6th Congress of the Cuban Communist Party in Havana. (Photo: Javier Galeano, AP)\\nIf all goes as expected, Cuba will name a new president in two weeks — the first time in nearly 60 years that the communist country\\'s leader won\\'t be a Castro.\\nOutgoing President Raúl Castro will still loom large in retirement, much like his older brother Fidel Castro, who hovered over the nation\\'s affairs in the years leading up to his death in 2016. But when the Cuban National Assembly meets April 19 to name the new president, it will mark a major shift in the history of the Caribbean island that has antagonized and tantalized Americans for decades.\\n\"This is not a transition to democracy, but this is enormous,\" said Pedro Freyre, an attorney with the Akerman law firm who represents several American companies doing business in Cuba. \"As our president would say, \\'It\\'s huge.\\' \"\\nCastro\\'s successor likely will be a man largely unknown outside Cuba: Miguel Díaz-Canel, 57, who has risen steadily through the ranks of the Communist Party of Cuba. His selection would represent a symbolic change for a regime mostly led by the bearded guerrillas who fought alongside the Castros during the 1959 revolution that overthrew the government of Fulgencio Batista.\\nDíaz-Canel\\'s ascension to the presidency is not a guarantee. Would-be successors have come and gone over the years. And there is always the possibility Castro chooses someone from the same generation as the Castro brothers and fellow revolutionary Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara.\\nIt also has become more difficult to assess the political situation in Cuba after the U.S. pulled most of its diplomats off the island. President Trump ordered a sharp drawdown at the U.S. Embassy in Havana after a series of mysterious \"health attacks\" against employees there.\\nStill, Cuba experts agree Castro probably will stand by Díaz-Canel.\\nCastro and his revolutionary cohorts could be making a pragmatic decision to anoint a younger leader at least to give the appearance the regime is changing with the times, said Frank Mora, director of the Kimberly Green Latin American and Caribbean Center at Florida International University.\\n\"They\\'re all in their late 80s,\" he said. \"They understand that they have to hand power over to someone who will live longer than a couple of years.\"\\nCuban First Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel attends the opening of the Havana International Book Fair on Feb. 1, 2018. Diaz-Canel is expected to be named president of Cuba in April after President Raul Castro steps down. (Photo: Adalberto Roque, AFP/Getty Images)\\nExperts disagree over how much power Díaz-Canel will truly hold and wonder whether Castro continues to run the show as head of the Communist Party of Cuba.\\nMora said Cuba won\\'t be entirely out of Castro\\'s grip until he\\'s dead. \"He\\'s still going to be there in the background, still wearing his four-star military uniform,\" he said.\\nThat role would suit Raúl, since he was always more comfortable operating in anonymity, unlike Fidel who basked in the spotlight, said Jaime Suchlicki, director of the Cuban Studies Institute in Miami.\\n\"Raúl never liked the diplomatic activities, going to the parties,\" Suchlicki said. \"So he\\'s going to put this guy in there and create a facade for the new generation. But Díaz-Canel is not going to have any decision-making power.\"\\nIt\\'s possible Castro is ready to hand over the reins and ease into retirement after nearly six decades of helping keep the government intact. He has talked about spending more time in his native Santiago, on the eastern end of the island and isolated from the diplomatic and economic hub of Havana.\\nFreyre said Castro probably will take a more diminished role, emerging only if the new crop of leaders stray too far from the script or bicker too much among themselves.\\n\"Think of it as a telenovela,\" Freyre said. \"The (father) is about to go. The kids are throwing their weight around, saying \\'Papa wanted me to have the hacienda\\' and another saying \\'He wanted me to have the Rolls Royce.\\'\\n\"Raúl is tired. He\\'s not going to run the show day to day. But if the elbow-throwing gets out of hand, the old guy comes in and says, \\'Enough!\\' \"\\nAnother question facing Díaz-Canel is whether he will be able to control the government ministries filled with Castro supporters.\\nThat includes Cuba\\'s military, officials who manage Cuba\\'s centrally planned economy and legions of provincial leaders who have run things a certain way for decades.\\n\"For being a \\'revolutionary government,\\' they are incredibly conservative,\" Freyre said. \"They\\'re very cautious; they\\'re very careful. This is a government that never rushes into doing anything.\"\\nDíaz-Canel seems fine with that. Experts describe him as a true believer in the Marxist-Leninist ideology that formed the basis of Fidel Castro\\'s government. He supported the marginal changes implemented during the 12 years of Raúl Castro\\'s rule, such as allowing Cubans to buy and sell property for the first time, work privately outside the state-run economy and get slightly expanded access to computers, cellphones and the Internet.\\nHe also has clearly adopted the anti-imperialistic stance of his predecessors. In a speech in October, he blasted the United States for its insistence that Cuba move toward a more democratic government.\\n\"Imperialism can never be trusted, not even a tiny bit, never,” Díaz-Canel said, echoing the words of Guevara on the 50th anniversary of his death.\\nIn the end, the biggest hurdle facing Díaz-Canel could be his ability to win over the public.\\nFidel and Raúl Castro could always point to their successful revolution as their claim to power. One can\\'t travel far in Cuba without finding a black-and-white photo of the brothers clawing through the mountains of eastern Cuba and fighting their way toward Havana.\\nDiaz-Canel \"doesn\\'t have those bona fides. He doesn\\'t have that credibility that the first generation of barbudos had,\" Mora said. \"His basis of legitimacy can\\'t be 1959. It has to be, \\'What have you done for me lately?\\' \"\\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2GAS7zj\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Franklin/AP\\nUpdated at 5:27 p.m. ET\\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that immigrants, even those with permanent legal status and asylum seekers, do not have the right to periodic bond hearings.\\nIt\\'s a profound loss for those immigrants appealing what are sometimes indefinite detentions by the government. Many are held for long periods of time — on average, 13 months — after being picked up for things as minor as joyriding. Some are held even longer.\\nThe case, Jennings v. Rodriguez, has implications for legal permanent residents whom the government wants to deport because they committed crimes and for asylum seekers who are awaiting a court date after turning themselves in at the border. Immigrant advocates contend that many of these immigrants have a right to be free on bail until their case is heard.\\nBut the court wrote in its 5-3 opinion Tuesday, \"Immigration officials are authorized to detain certain aliens in the course of immigration proceedings while they determine whether those aliens may be lawfully present in the country.\"\\nThe majority opinion was penned by Justice Samuel Alito and joined by the court\\'s conservatives. (Justice Elena Kagan did not participate. She recused herself, stemming from work she had done as former President Barack Obama\\'s solicitor general.)\\nThe decision reversed a Ninth Circuit ruling, but this is not the last word and could come back to the high court.\\nThe Supreme Court sent the case the back to the lower court with two questions unresolved. First, whether indefinite detention without a chance for bail is unconstitutional. Second, whether the challenge to that no-bail provision can be brought as a class action, instead of as individual cases.\\nStanford Law professor Lucas Guttentag says that in practical terms, the class action question is enormously important because most of the immigrants affected by Tuesday\\'s decision don\\'t have lawyers.\\n\"If they\\'re required to proceed individually, many of them will never be able to pursue their claims,\" he says. \"A class action provides protection to everyone, not just to those who have a lawyer who can file a lawsuit.\"\\nNo one can claim, nor since the time of slavery has anyone to my knowledge successfully claimed, that persons held within the United States are totally without constitutional protection.\\nOn Tuesday, Justice Stephen G. Breyer read from his dissent, a rare move for the court and an indication of just how passionately he disagrees with the majority opinion.\\n\"We need only recall the words of the Declaration of Independence,\" Breyer said, \"in particular its insistence that all men and women have \\'certain unalienable Rights,\\' and that among them is the right to \\'Liberty.\\' \"\\nHe continued, calling the ruling \"legal fiction.\"\\n\"Whatever the fiction, would the Constitution leave the Government free to starve, beat, or lash those held within our boundaries?\" Breyer argued. \"If not, then, whatever the fiction, how can the Constitution authorize the Government to imprison arbitrarily those who, whatever we might pretend, are in reality right here in the United States?\"\\nBreyer added, \"No one can claim, nor since the time of slavery has anyone to my knowledge successfully claimed, that persons held within the United States are totally without constitutional protection.\"\\nThe lead plaintiff in the case is a legal permanent resident, Alejandro Rodriguez, who came to the U.S. as a child and worked as a dental assistant. As a teenager, he was convicted for joyriding, and at 24, he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance.\\nRodriguez was detained for three years without the right to appear before a judge to ask for bond.\\nThe American Civil Liberties Union took up Rodriguez\\'s case. The civil rights group filed a class action lawsuit and eventually won his release and the cancellation of his deportation order. Rodriguez remains in the United States.\\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the immigrant detainees and asylum seekers can\\'t be detained indefinitely and that they have a right to a bond hearing every six months. The appellate court also held that in order to hold these detainees, the government must show that the immigrants would pose a danger or become a flight risk if set free.\\nThe Obama administration appealed to the high court, insisting that Congress — not the courts — has the power to make immigration law and that the law allows the government to detain \"criminal and terrorist aliens\" as well as \"aliens seeking admission to the United States.\"\\nThe Trump administration continued the case.\\nThe administration also argued that detained immigrants should not be recognized as a class that could bring legal action. Lawyers for the Justice Department said detainees should rely on individual habeas corpus petitions to challenge their detentions.\\nThe ACLU countered that few detainees have access to legal counsel and that a backlog of such habeas corpus petitions almost guarantees delays in winning release.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

I apologized and pledged that I would learn from my mistake,” John Parker said in a letter to local, state and national officials that tendered his resignation as the Duval County Democratic state committeeman and as a DNC member from Florida.\\nStory Continued Below\\n“I understand my error perpetuates divisiveness and does not allow us an opportunity for the important types of meaningful discourse — a conversation our party must engage in sooner rather than later — that help us grow as individuals and a party protecting the dignity of all people,” he wrote.\\nParker had said he meant to say “people of color” instead of “colored people” and eventually apologized for his offhanded remarks Jan. 22 after a local Democratic Party meeting in Jacksonville, Fla.\\n“I am confident that a full investigation would have shown that I erred with my mouth, not my heart,” Parker wrote, explaining he was resigning for the good of the party.\\nParker denied other accusations that he used more racially charged language. As he resisted calls to step down, some felt their complaints were being ignored in the ensuing months.\\nThat led to increased media scrutiny and the remarkable call by Parker’s wife, Duval County Democratic Executive Committee Chairwoman Lisa King, to say Monday that he should quit. After POLITICO published a story Wednesday on the controversy, Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo broke months of silence and said he needed to go.\\n“Along with DEC Chair Lisa King, I also asked John Parker to resign. I believe him stepping down is the right thing to do,” Rizzo said in a statement to POLITICO.\\nThough some Democrats felt the new chairwoman had done enough, insiders say she had held private conversations with surrogates to try to get Parker to leave his position. But he stayed on, troubling party officials who worried about the increasing racial tensions in Duval County, a key Florida battleground where the party is counting on strong black turnout in November if Gov. Rick Scott challenges Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and if Democrats are to win the governor’s mansion for the first time in 20 years.\\nOn Wednesday morning, Democratic gubernatorial candidate and former Rep. Gwen Graham called Parker — who had endorsed her — and asked him to quit and then publicly called on him to resign.\\n\"I am very concerned about this situation,” Graham said. “We need to bring Democrats together in 2018, not create distractions and divisions through our words and actions. I urge Mr. Parker to apologize fully and resign his positions as Duval County Democratic State Committeeman and on the Democratic National Committee.\"\\nTallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, the only African American gubernatorial candidate, joined with Graham in calling on Parker to quit as did one of Parker’s top African-American allies, state Sen. Audrey Gibson of Jacksonville.\\n“While I do not believe John had any intent of malice in the manner in which he spoke, it is imperative that for the good of this city and the local and statewide party that he take this action,” Gibson said in a written statement Wednesday.\\nBut another top Democratic official from the county, state Rep. Kimberly Daniels (D-Jacksonville), expressed more outrage and was the first elected official to call on him to quit. She also said Parker’s wife should step down as well because she showed “complicity” in not calling on him to resign until media pressure mounted.\\nBut as he stalled, Democrats began breaking their silence.\\nDaniels also leveled other more serious charges about Parker’s alleged use of racial language, including “disgraceful comments about integration.”\\n“Preceding this instance, he allegedly referred to the Working People Caucus as the ‘Poor Black People Working Caucus\\' and called a constituent the \\'mayor’s mammy,\\'\" Daniels wrote in a press statement Monday night. “Unlike, other leaders in Florida, even after a request from the Florida Black Caucus, Mr. Parker has not resigned.”\\nWhen Parker finally quit, he acknowledged his errors.\\n“I take responsibility for my mistake and as such is the impetus of my decision,” he said. “I resign for the good of my Party and all those who are fighting so hard for a better world than the one we are in now.”\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

So this is where we wanted to take a step back and look at what it all means. We'll start with NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thank you so much for joining us once again.\\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Happy to be here.\\nMARTIN: So what have we heard so far from President Trump since the shutdown started?\\nLIASSON: What we've heard from President Trump is a pretty simple message - and he said it over and over again on Twitter - Democrats are holding the military hostage over their desire for unchecked illegal immigration. And that's a message that I think his base will find very appealing, whether it helps him with anyone beyond his base is not clear.\\nMARTIN: And what about the Democrats and what about that argument? I mean, the polls show - and there's been some recent polling on this - it shows that the whole idea of protecting DACA recipients is politically popular but not when you've posed it as a tradeoff between...\\nLIASSON: Right.\\nMARTIN: ...You know, keeping the government open and helping them. So what about on the Democratic side?\\nLIASSON: The problem for both sides is that neither is convinced that the other guy will pay politically. For Democrats, they know, as you said, that something like 90 percent of Americans are sympathetic with their position on the DREAMers but not shutting down the government over the DREAMers. And when people are polled about who would you blame. It turns out that majorities, overall, would blame Republicans for a shutdown. After all, they control all branches of government.\\nBut in those big five states, the red states where Democratic Senate incumbents are running for re-election - and that's what Democrats are most worried about in those states - Missouri, Montana, West Virginia, Indiana, South Dakota - that's where Democrats would be blamed if it looks like they're doing this because of the DREAMers.\\nAnd in terms of whether the president would be blamed, we do know that the hashtag @Trumpshutdown, not @Schumershutdown, but @Trumpshutdown was the top trending topic on Twitter on Friday night. So a lot of people voted for him thinking he was a businessman who would come to Washington, make deals, which is what he promised, make the government work. And now here we are on the first anniversary of his inauguration with a shutdown.\\nMARTIN: Just building on that point, though, you know, in the past, the polls have suggested that Republicans were blamed for the shutdown but then they went on to midterm elections and actually did fine - in fact, did very, very well, according to the historical pattern that says, you know, the party in the White House tends to suffer in midterms, right? So any sense of what's going to happen this year?\\nLIASSON: Well, this is the first shutdown that we've ever had under one-party control of government. The last shutdown in 2013, of course, there was a Democrat in the White House, Republicans in Congress. And what you're talking about is absolutely true. What happened was Republicans initially were blamed for the shutdown.\\nThe approval ratings for the Republican Party dropped faster and deeper than they had ever dropped before during that shutdown. But then what people forget about is that then the Obamacare website debuted and crashed. And it totally wiped that story of the shutdown off the front pages. And that's what could happen now if we have a very short shutdown. If something happens to wipe this story in our kind of ADD news environment, we might be talking about something completely different a week from now.\\nMARTIN: Mara, just one more minute on this, if I could, before we head into the Barbershop because I'm going to ask them to reflect on this question. You know, here we are on the one-year anniversary of President Trump's inauguration. What more do we know about him now than we did a year ago?\\nLIASSON: Wow. Well, I think what we've - what I wondered about when he was inaugurated was, would he be different in degree or kind? Was he just a ruder, cruder kind of conservative Republican or something completely different? I think in terms of domestic policy, he's become a pretty standard conservative Republican - tax cuts, Neil Gorsuch, deregulation.\\nBut I think for - on the other hand, his divisive behavior and his continuing attacks on democratic institutions like the independent judiciary, free press, the FBI - I think that shows us that he conceives of the presidency in a completely different way than any of his predecessors. He doesn't see himself as the moral leader of the country or with the responsibility to unify the country. He has a totally different concept of the presidency.\\nMARTIN: That's NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thank you.\\nLIASSON: Thank you.\\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

He told investigators that he set up a meeting in the Seychelles between Prince and Russian sovereign wealth fund CEO Kirill Dmitriev, mere days before Trump was inaugurated, sources familiar with the investigation said this week.\\nNader has submitted to three interviews with special counsel investigators and four appearances before a federal grand jury in Washington since agents stopped him at Dulles International Airport in January, served him with a grand jury subpoena and seized his electronic devices, including his cell phone. Documents obtained by Mueller suggest that before and after Prince met Nader in New York a week before the trip to the Seychelles, Nader shared information with Prince about Dmitriev, sources familiar with the investigation told ABC News, which appears to be inconsistent with Prince’s sworn testimony before a U.S. House of Representatives investigative panel.\\n\"I didn\\'t fly there to meet any Russian guy,\" Prince told the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in November. He testified that he travelled to the Seychelles for a meeting with United Arab Emirates officials about possible business opportunities, and they introduced him – unexpectedly – to Dmitriev.\\nAs of late March, Mueller’s team has not asked Prince – whose sister Betsy DeVos serves as Trump’s Secretary of Education – to appear before the grand jury being used to investigate whether Trump campaign officials or transition aides colluded with Russian government operatives, according to one of Prince’s friends.\\nJason Alden/Bloomberg via Getty Images, FILE\\nPrince told the House Intelligence Committee that his meeting with Dmitriev was a chance encounter “down in the bar” at the suggestion of \"one of the brothers\" of the United Arab Emirates\\' leader Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed al-Nayhan.\\n\"At the end, one of the entourage says, \\'Hey, by the way, there’s this Russian guy that we’ve dealt with in the past. He’s here also to see someone from the Emirati delegation. And you should meet him. He\\'d be an interesting guy for you to know, since you’re doing a lot in the oil and gas and mineral space,’” Prince told lawmakers under oath in his sworn testimony. “So, as I recall, I met him, this same guy I talked about, Kirill Dmitriev. Met him down in the bar after dinner, and we talked for 30 minutes over a beer, and that was it.”\\nSources say Nader -- who worked at the time for the Emirati leader, known as \"MBZ” – tells a different story. According to multiple sources, the U.A.E., an important U.S. ally increasingly eager to be seen as a global powerbroker, wanted to bring a Russian close to the Kremlin together with someone Nader believed was a trusted confidant of members of the incoming administration.\\nSources tell ABC News Nader met with Prince at New York\\'s Pierre Hotel a week before the Jan. 11, 2017 meeting in the Seychelles, and later sent Prince biographical information about Dmitriev, which, according to those sources, noted that Dmitriev had been appointed by Putin to oversee the state-run sovereign wealth fund.\\nNader says he then facilitated and personally attended the meetings, including one between Prince and Dmitriev, at a resort owned by MBZ off the coast of East Africa, the sources told ABC News. One of the primary goals of the meeting, Nader told investigators, was to discuss foreign policy and to establish a line of communication between the Russian government and the incoming Trump administration, sources told ABC News.\\nNader — who Prince said in a 2010 lawsuit deposition had once represented his military contractor business in Iraq — was not mentioned in Prince\\'s congressional testimony despite Prince being asked by lawmakers who was present. Prince said only that Dmitriev\\'s wife was there but she left after a few minutes while they discussed terrorism and oil prices.\\nA spokesperson for Prince told ABC News on Thursday that \"Erik has said all there is to say to the committee and has nothing further to add.\" Prince has said that the Seychelles meeting was leaked to the news media last year in an illegal “unmasking” of his identity in U.S. signals intelligence intercepts.\\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\\nNader, a naturalized U.S. citizen, is an enigma in the nearly yearlong probe of the Trump presidential campaign\\'s dealings with Russians linked to the Kremlin.\\nHis background and credibility have come under attack as his name appeared in recent headlines. He has been arrested twice in the U.S., first in 1984 and again 1991, and convicted once, according to court records unsealed in March, for possession of pornographic videos featuring underage boys. He also reportedly served prison time in the Czech Republic in 2003 for similar crimes.\\nNader\\'s lawyers at powerhouse firm Latham & Watkins, which includes former Obama White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, have said unnamed individuals are dredging up the old criminal cases to discredit him as an important witness for Mueller. They declined to comment to ABC News on Nader\\'s interactions with the special counsel and Nader himself has refused to speak about the Russia probe.\\nFew in Washington remember George Nader, whose colorful biography reads like a spy thriller: his career has spanned the globe, and along the way he has been a hostage negotiator, arms broker, security operative and, now, an important witness for the former director of the FBI.\\nHe’s even negotiated with the Kremlin. According to Al-Monitor, a news website covering the Middle East, Nader helped broker a $4.2 billion arms deal between Iraq and Russia in 2012.\\nNader’s associates say he has embarked on countless sensitive diplomatic missions overseas and was once a special adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney. He had easy access to the White House under Presidents Reagan, both Bushes and Clinton, according to former officials, and he visited the Trump White House last year despite his criminal record.\\nNader posed with Trump for a picture and even helped arrange the new American president\\'s first major foreign trip to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia last year, two top Trump advisers told ABC News.\\n\"He has worked for the Israelis, the Syrians, the Iranians, the Saudis, the Emiratis, the Shiites in southern Iraq,\" said Mouafac Harb, a Lebanese former journalist who has known Nader for decades. \"He’s typical of the kind of shady operatives you often see in the Middle East.”\\nRon Sachs/AP Images, FILE\\nHis 1991 federal conviction in Alexandria, Virginia, for being caught returning from Germany with videotapes in his luggage \"depicting minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct\" highlights the conflicting chapters in his life.\\nProminent foreign policy figures sent testimonials to the federal trial court judge in Virginia, including one friend who said Nader, a Lebanese Christian, \"is risking his life\" to help free a dozen American, British and other hostages held in Beirut in 1991, by leveraging his close ties to the Shi\\'a terrorist group Hezbollah. The letters to the judge were provided to ABC News last week by Nader\\'s legal team.\\nThe judge in 1991 sentenced Nader to six months in a halfway house -- well below mandatory sentencing guidelines at that time -- and allowed him to travel to both Moscow and Beirut during his criminal proceedings, later citing Nader\\'s \"extraordinary cooperation with the government in certain areas.\"\\nThe 1991 criminal case was ordered sealed for six months. Instead, it remained under seal for 26 years, until a judge opened the case file last month amid news reports about Nader cooperating with Mueller. Sources told ABC News the U.S. government did not want Nader\\'s secrets easily unearthed while he operated as a backchannel on sensitive matters.\\n\"We used him because we needed all the channels we could get into the Syrian security establishment,\" said a former top career American diplomat in Damascus, who was aware of Nader\\'s activities in the years following his 1991 conviction. \"Nobody was looking for his child porn case. Nobody cared about that stuff at all back then. He was providing too invaluable a service to us.\"\\nNader, according to one former diplomat, has a rare and valuable skill.\\n\"His stock in trade is access and influence,” the former diplomat said. “He finds a way to be valuable to people.”\\nBut Nader had dropped off the radar of many former associates two decades ago, including those who worked in Washington for his \"Middle East Insight\" magazine, which held many foreign policy discussions hosted by Nader and televised on C-Span until it folded around the time of his criminal conviction.\\n\"Until his name appeared recently, I had no idea that Mr. Nader was even alive,\" said one former writer at the magazine, who, like most of Nader\\'s associates, declined to be identified by name.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

We have to get rid of him.”\\nBaldwin’s comments apparently struck a nerve for Trump, whose administration is reeling from a string of setbacks this week, including the departure of one of his closest confidants, Hope Hicks. He’s also under fire for appearing to cave to the NRA just a day after he promised to tackle gun control.\\nThe president responded to Baldwin’s comments with a rambling error-strewn post, in which he twice misspelled the actor’s name, as well as the word “dying.”\\nTwitter\\nTrump also urged “SNL” to bring back Darrell Hammond, who portrayed the then-reality star on the show until 2016.\\nThe tweet remained live for around 10 minutes before it was deleted.

Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2018\\nOne of those aides is Rob Porter, who resigned this week after his two former wives came forward and accused him of abusing them. On Friday night, The Washington Post first reported another White House aide, David Sorensen, resigned after his ex-wife accused him of abuse, including running over her foot with a car.\\nPorter\\'s first wife, Colbie Holderness, revealed an image of herself with a blackened eye in 2005, which she said she received from Porter punching her while they were on vacation in Florence, Italy. In June 2010, Porter\\'s second wife, Jennie Willoughby, filed an emergency protective order against Porter, whom she says dragged her naked from the shower.\\nPorter has denied the allegations.\\nIn the wake of the claims, the president wished Porter well on Friday, saying nothing of Porter\\'s accusers other than he was \"very sad\" to hear of the allegations.\\n\"He worked very hard,\" the president said in the Oval Office Friday. \"I found out about it recently and I was surprised by it. But we certainly wish him well. It\\'s obviously a tough time for him. He did a very good job when he was in the White House. And we hope he has a wonderful career, and hopefully he will have a great career ahead of him. But it was very sad when we heard about it, and certainly he\\'s also very sad. Now he also as you probably know, he says he\\'s innocent. And I think you have to remember that. He said very strongly yesterday that he\\'s innocent. So you\\'ll have to talk to him about that. But we absolutely wish him well. Did a very good job while he was at the White House.\"\\nThe White House\\'s response to the allegations leveled against Porter sent the White House scrambling. Porter warned White House counsel Don McGahn in January 2017 that there could be a holdup with his security clearance, CBS News has reported. In June 2017, Porter\\'s preliminary file was sent from the FBI to the White House security office. It contained information from his ex-wives alleging abuse. The file never went to McGahn personally, but it may have gone to another attorney in the White House counsel\\'s office. In September of 2017, Porter told McGahn the FBI had interviewed him a second time.\\nMcGahn became more clearly aware of the nature of those concerns in November 2017 when Porter\\'s former girlfriend called him to tell him of the abuse allegations from the former wives. Shortly after that, McGahn informed chief of staff John Kelly that there could be problems related to Porter\\'s security clearance. But, the White House took no action, waiting until after the Daily Mail reported the former wives\\' claims Tuesday night. White House communications director Hope Hicks, CBS News has confirmed, is dating Porter, although it\\'s unclear when she became aware of the allegations.\\nCBS News\\' Arden Farhi contributed to this report.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

So much Hennessy is being sold, in fact, that one New Hampshire official is asking the state Attorney General Gordon MacDonald to investigate whether the Liquor Commission is turning a blind eye to bootlegging and money-laundering activities.\\nNew Hampshire, despite its pronounced libertarian streak, is one of 17 \"control\" states, meaning the government manages the distribution of spirits. The state\\'s Liquor Commission, which is run by an appointed chairman, oversees 79 retail stores.\\nAndru Volinsky, a Democrat who serves on the state\\'s five-member Executive Council, an elected body that serves as a kind of watchdog over the executive branch, made the allegations public last month.\\nAfter being tipped off by a whistleblower, Volinsky says he recently witnessed two people who arrived in a vehicle with New York license plates spend approximately $24,000 on Hennessy products. At the register, they allegedly divided the sale into three transactions and paid using \"a very large wad of cash.\" He suspects people are buying up large quantities of New Hampshire\\'s tax-free booze to sell elsewhere.\\nThe IRS requires businesses to document when someone spends more than $10,000 in cash on a single purchase. By allowing customers to break up the transactions, Volinsky contends the Liquor Commission may be evading that reporting requirement. He\\'s also concerned that the Liquor Commission isn\\'t doing enough to police customers who may stop at multiple stores in a single day to avoid triggering the $10,000 reporting requirement.\\nThese practices \"may be illegal and unquestionably facilitate money laundering,\" writes Volinsky in a letter to the governor and state attorney general.\\nLiquor Commission denies allegations\\nThe New Hampshire Liquor Commission is a cash cow, generating more than $150 million in profits last year that went directly into the state\\'s general fund. These government-run liquor stores are strategically located near the state\\'s borders, including at highway rest stops, where motorists can enjoy tax-free shopping and better prices than in nearby Vermont and Massachusetts.\\nAccording to publicly available online inventories, those border stores stock huge quantities of Hennessy products. Meanwhile, just a handful of bottles may be on the shelves at stores located far from the border.\\nIt isn\\'t clear why Hennessy appears to be the brand of choice for bootleggers, but the price difference between New Hampshire\\'s bottles and the highly-taxed New York bottles is likely one draw. Also, government officials have offered anecdotal evidence that some of the booze is headed for Chinese restaurants, as well as gentleman\\'s clubs in the greater New York City region.\\n\"I started hearing anecdotes of people coming in with wads of cash stuffed in their socks,\" Volinsky tells New Hampshire Public Radio. \"Wads of cash that smell of perfume because on Wednesdays, apparently the strip club owners in New York come over to buy their liquor in bulk, and the office of the liquor store smells from the perfume.\"\\nFor its part, the Liquor Commission flatly denies Volinsky\\'s allegations.\\n\"There\\'s nothing illegal or unscrupulous about making large sales to out-of-state customers as long as our employees follow the policies in place set forth by the state and federal government,\" writes the commission in a statement. It has provided employees with a step-by-step guide to ensure financial disclosure laws are appropriately followed.\\nThe Commission, along with top Republicans in the state, including Governor Chris Sununu, have gone on the attack, criticizing Volinsky for his \"sting operation,\" and are calling for the attorney general to investigate him.\\nPrevious investigation\\nWhile a partisan tit-for-tat was perhaps inevitable, many of the concerns raised by Volinsky are not new to New Hampshire officials, or to law enforcement in neighboring states.\\nIn fact, in 2012, it was a top GOP lawmaker who called for a special House committee to investigate potential wrongdoing within the Liquor Commission, including how it handles large cash purchases.\\nThat committee\\'s final report included two anecdotes of out-of-state residents arrested in Massachusetts with large hauls of New Hampshire-purchased booze. One of those arrests included 1,676 bottles of Hennessy, bought at multiple locations. The driver was charged with possessing untaxed liquor and unlawfully transporting liquor.\\nMore recently, liquor enforcement officials in Vermont have made two arrests, one involving an estimated $40,000 worth of New Hampshire-purchased liquor in the back of an SUV, the other with an estimated $28,000 worth. Both suspects were charged with crossing state lines in possession of more than nine liters of alcohol, Vermont\\'s current legal limit.\\n\"The product that was the most prominent in both of these cases was Hennessy cognac,\" says Patrick Delaney, Vermont\\'s Commissioner of Liquor Control, who backs increasing the financial penalties for those caught illegally importing large quantities of liquor. He adds that \"by using cash, there is obviously no paper trail, if an authority were to investigate it. The activity itself is basically tax evasion.\"\\nAn IRS spokesperson says the agency is \"aware of this and similar schemes\" but wouldn\\'t confirm any active investigation into all-cash bulk transactions in New Hampshire.\\nPotential repercussions\\nPoliticians are not the only ones asking questions. Some employees of New Hampshire liquor stores are raising concerns about their role in processing these transactions.\\n\"They are starting to feel like a drug dealer,\" says Richard Gulla, president of the State Employees Association, the union which represents rank and file liquor store employees.\\nTo handle the huge stacks of cash and speed up transactions, the Liquor Commission has installed 20 bill-counting machines at stores around the state, and says it plans to roll out more units.\\nVolinsky sees these steps and others taken by the Liquor Commission as \"alarming.\"\\nThe state attorney general\\'s office says it is reviewing the documents submitted by Volinsky and isn\\'t yet able to comment on their contents.\\nNHPR\\'s Casey McDermott contributed to this report.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

The executive order has suffered numerous legal setbacks since then, the most recent being a decision by a federal judge in California ruling it unconstitutional and issuing a permanent injunction, effectively blocking it.\\nDespite this, some lawmakers in Florida are attempting to pass dangerous legislation that threatens the wellbeing of immigrant families.\\nHouse Bill 9 (HB9) has been introduced by Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran and has so far been fast tracked through committee. The current Florida House of Representatives website currently has an ominous looking banner in its homepage, with information both about the bill and so called “sanctuary cities,” in what I interpret as a scare tactic.\\nAnti-immigrant legislation in Florida is not new. Immigration advocacy groups have been fighting against dangerous bills like HB9 for years, most memorably in 2011 when the state capitol in Tallahassee was flooded by activists from the Florida Immigrant Coalition who were taking part in a We Are Florida campaign and were able to stop an Arizona style “Show me your papers” law. Advocates have spent almost every legislative session since then fighting against the criminalization of immigrant families.\\nThe upcoming gubernatorial race, and especially the contested primary on the Republican side, is contributing to the urgency lawmakers seem to be feeling in Florida regarding anti-immigrant efforts. The Republican candidates seem to be in a competition to outdo each other in terms of who is the best adherent of Trumpism.\\nPerceived frontrunner Adam Putnam has downplayed support for legislation he once co-sponsored that would have allowed undocumented immigrants to work in the United States and receive a pathway to legal residency.\\nRep. Ron Desantis, who has won Trump’s endorsement, had this to say after Trump rescinded DACA, the executive order granting protection from deportation to thousands of undocumented students: “When he did it, how the media has reacted, how most politicians – Democrats and even a lot of Republicans – react; the sole focus is on what can Congress do to benefit an illegal immigrant?”\\nBut the current bill before Florida lawmakers takes anti-immigrant bias to new heights. The bill would discourage immigrants who are victims of a crime from cooperating with law enforcement agencies, would criminalize immigrant parents of U.S. citizens in Florida and would infringe on the power of local municipalities from enacting policies that would serve the best interests of their residents.\\nIn an editorial in the Tampa Bay Times, Corcoran said, “Our bill is simple: State and local governments must comply with and support the enforcement of federal immigration laws — end of story. Any elected officials who thinks they can circumvent the Constitution and the laws of our nation will face significant penalties, along with suspension or removal from office.”\\nThat is perhaps one of the most troubling aspects of the proposed law, it will leave elected officials who do not support the criminalization and deportation of immigrant families vulnerable to being removed from office. That is simply not in the spirit of American democracy, and would create a dangerous slippery slope in which authoritarians could use similar laws to silence their opposition. It simply cannot be allowed to happen.\\nHB9 cannot be allowed to pass by the Florida Legislature. It would make our communities less safe by eroding the trust between the public and law enforcement, would lead to the racial profiling and discrimination of immigrant communities, and would cost Florida residents thousands upon thousands of taxpayer dollars. Furthermore, studies have repeatedly found that municipalities and counties with sanctuary or welcoming policies are safer and have better economies than those without.\\nIn the past, bipartisan efforts by both Democrats and Republicans in the Florida Senate have defeated these anti-immigrant bills. Considering the current moment, we need state lawmakers to step up and do right by the most vulnerable communities in the state of Florida.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

That included prosecuting parents traveling with their children as well as people who subsequently attempted to request asylum.\\nWhite House officials have repeatedly acknowledged that under that new policy, they separate all families who cross the border. Sessions has described it as deterrence.\\nIn Their Own Words President Trump: \"The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility. ... Not on my watch.\" Attorney General Jeff Sessions: \"If you cross this border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It\\'s that simple. ... If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law. If you don\\'t like that, then don\\'t smuggle children over our border.\" Sessions on whether the policy is a deterrent: \"Yes, hopefully people will get the message and come through the border at the port of entry and not break across the border unlawfully.\" Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen: Under the \"zero tolerance\" policy, when families cross the border illegally, \"Operationally, what that means is we will have to separate your family. That\\'s no different than what we do every day in every part of the United States when an adult of a family commits a crime.\" White House Chief of Staff John Kelly: Separating families is \"a tough deterrent. ... The children will be taken care of — put into foster care or whatever. But the big point is they elected to come illegally into the United States and this is a technique that no one hopes will be used extensively or for very long.\"\\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection explains on its site and in a flyer that border-crossing families will be separated.\\nThe policy is unique to the Trump administration. Previous administrations did not, as a general principle, separate all families crossing the U.S. border illegally. And the current administration could choose to end this practice and release families together from detention at any time.\\nWhat happens when families are separated?\\nThe process begins at a Border Patrol detention facility. But many details about what happens next — how children are taken from their parents and by whom — are unclear.\\nAccording to the Texas Civil Rights Project, which has been able to speak with detained adults, multiple parents reported that they were separated from their children and not given any information about where their children would go. The organization also says that in some cases, the children were taken away under the pretense that they would be getting a bath.\\nThe Los Angeles Times spoke to unnamed Homeland Security officials who said parents are given information about the family separation process and that \"accusations of surreptitious efforts to separate are completely false.\"\\nFrom the point of separation forward, the policy for treating the separated children appears to be the same as existing systems for detaining and housing unaccompanied immigrant children — designed for minors who cross the border alone. Those unaccompanied minors are generally older than the children affected by family separation.\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption U.S. Customs and Border Protection\\'s Rio Grande Valley Sector via AP U.S. Customs and Border Protection\\'s Rio Grande Valley Sector via AP\\nWhere do the children go once they\\'ve been separated?\\nThe answer varies over time. Children begin at Border Patrol facilities, are transferred to longer-term shelters and are supposed to eventually be placed with families or sponsors. Here\\'s more about each step:\\nBorder Patrol facilities. If you\\'ve seen photos of children in what look like chain-link cages — whether unaccompanied minors in 2014 or separated children in 2018 — they are probably photos from a Border Patrol facility.\\nChildren usually are held here initially, but it is illegal to keep them for more than three days — these holding cells are not meant for long-term detainment.\\nThe Associated Press visited one site on Monday and described a \"large, dark facility\" with separate wings for children, adults and families:\\n\"Inside an old warehouse in South Texas, hundreds of children wait in a series of cages created by metal fencing. One cage had 20 children inside. Scattered about are bottles of water, bags of chips and large foil sheets intended to serve as blankets.\"\\nSuch facilities have been criticized before for poor conditions and reports of abuse and inhumane treatment, including a number of allegations the CBP strongly denies.\\nChild immigrant shelters. Within three days, children are supposed to be transferred from immigration detention to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services.\\nFor 15 years, ORR has handled the \"care and placement\" of unaccompanied migrant children. Until recently, that usually meant minors who crossed into the U.S. alone. Now it also includes children who have been separated from their families by authorities, including much younger children.\\nORR has a network of about 100 shelter facilities, all operated by nonprofit groups, where children are detained.\\nNPR\\'s John Burnett recently joined other reporters to visit one such facility, a converted Walmart Supercenter housing nearly 1,500 boys ages 10 to 17. Journalists\\' access to that facility in Brownsville, Texas, was limited, but the site was markedly different from Border Patrol facilities seen in photos released by the government — the teenage boys slept on beds instead of mats in the floor, in rooms instead of cages, and had access to classes and games.\\nORR says children remain at these shelters for \"fewer than 57 days on average.\" However some children have been kept detained for months longer than that, and some advocates say certain facilities improperly administer psychotropic medications.\\nObservers have raised concerns about the psychological toll on young children who enter this shelter system. NPR\\'s Joel Rose talked to one former shelter employee who said he quit after he was instructed to prevent siblings from hugging each other. The organization that runs the shelter said it allows touching and hugging in certain circumstances.\\nWhere are the girls and young children?\\nOfficial photos and videos have shown only older boys at shelter facilities.\\nHHS says there are specialized shelters for children under 13. No images from those shelters have been released, but authorities say new images and videos will be provided later this week.\\nMore than 10,000 migrant children, including children who crossed the border alone, are kept in ORR facilities. And existing facilities are filling up — the shelter Burnett visited was 95 percent full.\\nTent camps. A temporary facility has been set up in Tornillo, Texas, near El Paso. Little is known about the facility, and reporters have not been allowed outside, but KQED\\'s John Sepulvado has seen the tent from outside.\\n\"It\\'s a heavy-duty-grade white tent in the middle of a desert,\" he told NPR\\'s Here & Now. \"It\\'s behind two chain-link fences and there\\'s a dirt easement that\\'s on top of it so you can\\'t actually see into it from the American side.\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters\\n\"It\\'s not a city — there aren\\'t multiples of tents,\" he said. \"It\\'s just all one tent where these 16- and 17-year-olds are at.\"\\nIt\\'s not clear how many teenagers are inside, he says, but the government plans to expand it to hold some 4,000 detained minors.\\nThis is not the first time the U.S. government has used temporary shelters for minors: During the surge of unaccompanied minors crossing the border in 2014, HHS set up several temporary facilities at military bases.\\nSponsors or family members: Ultimately, ORR tries to find family members, foster parents or sponsors to take in children. Parents are the preferred option, but that\\'s not a possibility for children who have been separated from parents who remain in detention.\\nThere is no time limit on how long it can take to find a home for a child, but again, ORR says that on average the process takes less than two months.\\nBy law, those relatives or sponsors must, among other requirements, show that they can provide for the minor — sometimes verified with home visits — and ensure the minor\\'s attendance at any future court hearing.\\nThe Trump administration has said that it intends to subject sponsors to increased scrutiny.\\nUnder those new rules, the criminal background and immigration status of all sponsors, and any other adult living in the household, will be examined. Biometric data, such as fingerprints, also will be required. The checks will be performed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and not by ORR.\\nCritics say these new background checks will have a chilling effect.\\n\"Under the current circumstances and given the anti-immigrant rhetoric of the administration, it may be that few will be willing to come forward to claim children,\" said Bob Carey, who was director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement under the Obama administration.\\nCan parents who are prosecuted be reunited with their children?\\nParents face a court hearing where, as NPR\\'s John Burnett has reported, they may face objections from prosecutors if their lawyers try to bring up their children in a bid for leniency.\\nIf parents are eventually released from detention, they will be able to take custody of their own children, Nielsen said at a news conference Monday.\\nICE instructions on how to find a separated child The Immigration and Customs Enforcement call center is available M-F, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET, at 1-888-351-4024 (or 9116# from within an ICE facility)\\nParents can call the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which operates shelters, at 1-800-203-7001 (or 699# from within an ICE detention facility)\\nFriends, family and advocates can email ICE at Parental.Interests@ice.dhs.gov or ORR at information@ORRNCC.com\\nIn a statement to NPR, ICE expanded on the process of family reunification.\\nDuring a parent\\'s detention, \"ICE and ORR will work together to locate separated children, verify the parent/child relationship, and set up regular communication and removal coordination, if necessary,\" ICE says. A hotline has been set up to help parents and children find each other.\\n\"ICE will make every effort to reunite the child with the parent once the parent\\'s immigration case has been adjudicated,\" a spokesman said. Parents being deported may request that their children leave with them, or may decide to leave the child in the U.S. to pursue their own immigration claim, ICE says. For instance, they might suggest another family member in the U.S. to sponsor their child, as described above.\\nHowever, The New Yorker spoke to lawyers and advocates who said there is no formal process or clear protocol for tracking parents and children within the system, and that chaotic systems and inadequate record-keeping make it difficult even to know which facility a child might be kept at.\\nAnd The New York Times reports that some parents have been deported without their children, against their will.\\nWhat is the law regarding the treatment of migrant children?\\nA two-decade-old court settlement, the Flores settlement, and a law called the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (or TVPRA) both specify how the government must treat migrant children.\\nThey require that migrant children be placed in \"the least restrictive environment,\" or sent to live with family members. They also limit how long families with children can be detained; courts have interpreted that limit as 20 days.\\nPrevious administrations have released families to meet these requirements. President Trump has said the law requires him to separate families, which is not true. His advisers have presented a more complicated argument for how the law requires family separation.\\n\"The laws prohibit us from detaining families while they go through prosecution,\" Homeland Secretary Nielsen said on Monday — a reference to the 20-day limits on how long children can be detained. Therefore, she says, \"we cannot detain families together.\"\\nShe argues that that leaves the administration with the options of not enforcing the law, which they reject, or separating families. But immigration advocates and legal experts say that there are other options, including those previous administrations have chosen.\\nWhat was the policy under President Obama?\\nThe Obama administration established family detention centers that kept families together while their cases were processed.\\nHowever, those centers were sharply criticized for keeping children detained even if they were still with their parents. A court ruled that those detention centers violated the Flores agreement and that families should be released together.\\nThe Obama White House also had a policy of releasing families through a program called Alternatives to Detention that still allowed them to be closely supervised — for instance, by giving mothers ankle monitors before releasing them.\\nThe ACLU welcomed the Alternatives to Detention program but other immigrant rights groups had reservations.\\nAs NPR\\'s John Burnett reported, one for-profit prison company that was making money off immigrant detention was also profiting off those ankle monitor systems.\\nICE tells NPR that the Alternatives to Detention program is still active under the Trump administration, but Trump has repeatedly said he opposes what he denounces as \"catch-and-release.\"\\nCan families claim asylum, allowing them to stay together?\\nHypothetically, yes. In practice, maybe not.\\nFamilies that claim asylum at ports of entry are meant to be kept together while their claims are processed.\\nBut there is evidence that even families who seek asylum at ports of entry are being separated. One high-profile case involves a Congolese woman who sought asylum and still was separated from her 7-year-old daughter. In February, NPR\\'s Burnett reported on the legal battle of Ms. L v. ICE.\\nWhat is asylum? Claiming asylum means asking the U.S. to accept you — legally — because of persecution you\\'re facing in your home country. Crossing the border illegally is a misdemeanor; for a person who\\'s already been deported once, it\\'s a felony. Both types of crimes are currently being prosecuted with no exceptions, even if a person later claims asylum. Claiming asylum at a port of entry, however, is not a crime at all.\\nHers is not an isolated case, according to immigrant advocates.\\n\"Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service has documented 53 incidents of family separation in the last nine months, mostly Central Americans. Other immigrant support groups say there are many more cases,\" Burnett reported.\\nReporter Jean Guerrero of KPBS in San Diego reported on the case of a Salvadoran father, Jose Demar Fuentes, who says he sought asylum and was separated from his 1-year-old son, Mateo, despite having an original birth certificate proving that he is the boy\\'s father.\\nIn a White House press briefing Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said, \"DHS is not separating families legitimately seeking asylum at ports of entry.\" But she said DHS \"will only separate a family if we cannot determine there is a familial relationship, if child is at risk with the parent or legal guardian, or if the parent or legal guardian is referred for prosecution.\"\\nBurnett also has reported that some families are not being allowed to claim asylum — that they are being repeatedly turned away and told the CBP facility is too full to accept them.\\nNielsen has denied that some asylum-seekers who present themselves at a port of entry are being turned away, which would be a violation of international law.\\n\"We are saying we want to take care of you in the right way. Right now we do not have the resources at this particular moment in time. Come back,\" she said.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

This time: an influential research project on growth mindset\\nThere is a wealth of psychology research that can help teachers to improve how they work with students, but academic studies of this kind aren’t always easy to access or translate into the realities of classroom practice. This series seeks to redress that by taking a selection of studies and making sense of the important information for teachers, as we all seek to answer the question: how can we help our students do better at school? This time, we consider growth mindset.\\nGrowth mindset – the idea that intelligence can be developed rather than it being set in stone – is arguably the most popular psychological theory in education at the moment. It was launched into mainstream consciousness after a seminal growth mindset study almost 20 years ago and has since spawned many assemblies and form tutor-time activities. But what were the findings of this influential study?\\nThe problem with praise such as \\u200b\\u200b'you're so clever\\u200b' is that it doesn't tell students what they need to do next time\\nWriting in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 1998, Claudia Mueller and Carol Dweck from Columbia University, New York, explored the consequences of how different types of praise affected students. The research paper is actually a combination of six separate studies.\\nIn each, students aged nine to 12 years old completed a problem-solving game. They were then told they’d got 80% of the questions right and were praised for either their natural intelligence or how hard they worked on the task. The researchers reported on how the students felt, thought and behaved in subsequent tasks.\\nWhat are the main findings?\\nChildren who were praised for their intelligence were more likely to choose future tasks that they thought would make them look smart. Children who had been praised for their effort tended to choose tasks that would help them learn new things.\\nChildren praised for their intelligence said they enjoyed the task less when compared to the children who had been praised for their effort.\\nChildren praised for their intelligence were less likely to persist on tasks than the children who had been praised for their effort.\\nChildren who had been praised for their intelligence performed worse in future tasks. The children who had been praised for their effort performed better in future tasks.\\nThe majority (86%) of children praised for their intelligence asked for information about how their peers did on the same task. Only 23% of children who had been praised for effort asked for this type of feedback – most of them asked for feedback about how they could do better.\\nA significant proportion (38%) of children praised for their ability lied about the number of problems they solved in the task. Only 13% of the children praised for effort did the same.\\nRelated research\\nIn the intervening years, the impact of growth mindset has been studied by many different researchers around the world. The overwhelming majority of these have found that having a growth mindset is associated with getting better grades. Some of these studies included a very large sample size, of more than 100,000 students. However, two recent studies paint a slightly more cloudy picture.\\nGrowth mindset: practical tips you may not have tried yet Read more\\nIn England, researchers found that improvements in English and maths [pdf] attributed to growth mindset interventions (on average, students made two months’ additional progress) could have been down to chance. The other study, involving 222 students in China, found no relationship between student mindset and their academic performance.\\nBut beyond improved attainment, research suggests having a growth mindset has other advantages, including coping better with transition, higher self-regulation, grit and pro-social behaviours. There is also evidence suggesting mental health benefits – those with a growth mindset have been found to be less aggressive, with higher self-esteem and fewer symptoms associated with depression and anxiety.\\nWhat does this mean for the classroom?\\nThis study highlights the complexities and importance of how we deliver feedback. The problem with praise such as “you’re so clever” or “you must be so talented” is that it doesn’t tell students what they need to do next time.\\nBy praising their effort and the strategies they used, we give students a template of behaviour to follow. As the authors of the study noted: “Children exposed to this intelligence feedback were likely to respond negatively when they faced achievement setbacks … children given effort feedback, who valued learning over performance, were less likely to fall apart when they experienced an isolated low performance.” Studies like this must therefore make us consider the merit of calling certain students “gifted and talented”.\\nIt’s also worth being aware of the ways in which the idea of growth mindset is sometimes misunderstood. In the rush to embrace it as a method, the message has sometimes been diluted to “growth mindset is all about effort” or morphed into “anyone can do anything” – neither of which is accurate or helpful. Having a growth mindset is about the belief that someone can learn and improve. To help shape students’ behaviours and mindsets, teachers should look to develop a consistent culture of high expectations and quality feedback.\\n• Bradley Busch is a registered psychologist, director at InnerDrive and author of Release Your Inner Drive.

Return the cause and effect phrases.\\n\\n### Text:\\nThere’s been so much going on in recent weeks that it’s hard to remember that the biggest story in the world is the rapid rise of China.\\nYes, it’s fascinating to see what’s happening with the Trump-Kim Summit in Singapore, or at the Trump vs. Trudeau Smackdown in Canada, or to peek into the the bottomless Swampathon of Washington, DC. Yet still, while it’s not always atop the headlines, the most consequential story of the age is the rise and rise of the People’s Republic.\\nAnd perhaps the fate of a city in Brazil serves as a parable as to what could be looming for our American republic. Virgil will get to that scary parable in a moment, but first, let’s consider the latest news.\\nAn Artful Deal with China—But Artful for Whom?\\nOn June 12, China’s telecom giant ZTE announced it is resuming business operations, after having been staved off some U.S. sanctions that could have shut it down completely. A bipartisan group of US Senators is still struggling to toughen up those sanctions, and so it’s unclear what will happen next, but it seems likely, in the end, that ZTE will wriggle out of the most serious possible punishment. Which is to say, how long do you think it will be before ZTE is back up to its old tricks?\\nIn other words, the Chinese seem to be showing that they understand, too, 交易的艺术—The Art of the Deal.\\nAnd speaking of deals, late last month, National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow said the administration was “making terrific progress” in its trade talks with China, aimed at lowering the U.S. trade deficit with that country, currently running at $375 billion annually. That same day, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, “We’re putting the trade war on hold,” pending possible progress.\\nOf course, some were skeptical—even in surprising places. For instance, also late last month, The Washington Post headlined, “China is winning Trump’s trade war.” Yes, we know where the “Bezos Post” is coming from, but still, the story quoted a number of experts and politicians, all of whom argued that the Chinese are likely to be unyielding on key trade issues, such as manufacturing exports and the protection of U.S. intellectual property (IP). And the Post cited the administration’s own estimate that China is stealing between $225 billion and $600 billion worth of our IP each year. We might pause to observe that it’s these matters of technological know-how that are the crux of national power—even national survival.\\nInterestingly, this somber realization is starting to penetrate Beltway thinking. For instance, a recent headline atop Axios, the buzzy Beltway publication, was veritably Trumpian: “1 big thing: The greatest, growing threat to America.” The article detailed China’s 2025 Plan, which calls for the country “to dominate all futuristic advanced technologies such as robotics, A.I., aviation and space, driverless or new energy vehicles.” The conclusion is inescapable: If the Chinese beat us in all those categories, they beat us, period.\\nOf course, Donald Trump has been sounding exactly this alarm for decades, even when the bipartisan Establishment was swooning over the mirage of globalism. Giving credit where credit is due, the author of the piece, Jim VandeHei—one of the most influential journalists in Washington, DC—added a note about the 45th President: “Trump showed you can turn China into a villain on trade.” Looking beyond Trump, VandeHei added: “A smart politician could turn China into a unifying villain on virtually every topic—a reason to move fast and together on infrastructure, immigration, regulations, space, robotics, 5G and next-gen education.”\\nIn other words, the threat from China could finally galvanize the U.S. to do the things that we should have been doing all along.\\nAnd so it was interesting to see that at the moment that the importance of technology was being acknowledged, the breaking news from the White House was about agriculture; on May 21, Trump tweeted the news:\\nChina has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products – would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years!\\nYes, undoubtedly the President is correct when he says that this deal would be one the best thing to happen to US farmers—and farmers and their farms are certainly important; we do, after all, have to eat. However, as we have seen, the most profound concerns are elsewhere. What matters most to our national destiny is tech, not ag.\\nVirgil doesn’t often find himself agree with Sen. Chuck Schumer, but the New York Democrat had a piercing point when he jibed soon thereafter:\\nChina’s trade negotiators must be laughing themselves all the way back to Beijing. They’re playing us for fools — temporary purchase of some goods, while China continues to steal our family jewels, the things that have made America great: the intellectual property, the know-how in the highest end industries.\\nVirgil will leave it to others to assess Schumer’s credibility on this issue; for sure, he seems more critical of Trump than he was of, say, Barack Obama. And yet also for sure, he’s right about this much: The ultimate issue in national prosperity, even national survival, is know-how. That is, do we know how to do something better than our economic and military rivals? And a look back at history drills that point home—you have to stay ahead of the competition.\\nSilicon Valley, Meet Manaus, Brazil\\nNobody should ever make the mistake of thinking that anything about the economy is permanent. That is, the economy is always churning and changing; some players are winning, and some are losing. Moreover, the same holds true for society and, indeed, for history itself; one empire rises, another falls. And it’s hard to say that any country is immune, not even the United States.\\nA classic expression of this waxing and waning is the 1818 poem by Percy Shelley, Ozymandias. That work describes a traveler trekking through the desert, coming across the remains of a once-towering statue:\\nAnd on the pedestal, these words appear:\\nMy name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;\\nLook on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!\\nThe poem concludes on a somber note:\\nNothing beside remains. Round the decay\\nOf that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare\\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\\nOzymandias, by the way, was a real king. His name is better known to us as Ramses II; he was a pharaoh in Egypt’s glory days, when Egypt was arguably the world’s leading civilization. And yet now…\\nSuch gloomy thoughts, about the death of kings and kingdoms, were brought to Virgil’s mind by a recent headline, “In Silicon Valley, Chinese ‘accelerators’ aim to bring startups home.” The Reuters article details the efforts of the People’s Republic of China to invest in and learn from—some would say, steal from—the greatest U.S. tech firms.\\nSen. Mark Warner (D-VA), vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, outlined the risk:\\nOur intellectual property is the future of our economy and our security. China’s government has clearly prioritized acquiring as much of that intellectual property as possible. Their ongoing efforts, legal or illegal, pose a risk that we have to look at very seriously.\\nWe might emphasize Warner’s use of the word “illegal.” Why, he might even agree with the Trump administration’s estimate that China steals as much as $600 billion of our intellectual property every year. In fact, that same day, May 17, the President himself declared, “We have been ripped off by China”—and this only hours before a visit to the White House by Chinese vice premier Liu He.\\nSo what could happen to the US if this thievery continues? Today, without a doubt, the US enjoys tech pre-eminence. The largest of our tech titans, the so-called GAFA companies—Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon—have a total market capitalization of more than $2.4 trillion, vastly greater than that of the Chinese tech companies.\\nOf course, as we all know, China is catching up fast—in everything. Just a decade ago, China’s GDP was less than a third of America’s, and yet if current growth rates continue—the U.S. at around 2 percent, and China at around 6.5 percent—China will overtake the U.S. in 2027. If that projection proves true, then America’s tech edge could vanish just as surely as that statue of Ozymandias.\\nIn fact, if we want a glimpse of what a possible future might look like, we might take a look at Manaus, Brazil. That city’s bitter history illustrates what can happen when someone steals away your economic mojo.\\nToday, Manaus is just another Brazilian city, population 2.1 million. And yet in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was one of the boom cities of the world, based on a supremely valuable product: rubber.\\nThe peoples of the Amazon had long known that a viscous substance, latex, could be tapped from the Hevea brasiliensis tree; they had found occasional uses for it when it dried into rubber.\\nYet natural rubber had a problem: It invariably turned gooey in the summer and brittle in the winter, and so it wasn’t good for much. But all that changed after 1839, when the American inventor Charles Goodyear figured out how to “vulcanize”—that is, permanently weatherproof—latex rubber.\\nGoodyear’s vulcanization opened up new vistas for the use for rubber; it was now not just a curiosity, but a valuable commodity. And so all of a sudden, in the mid 19th century, attention—and money—turned to the source of that rubber, the Amazon rain forest. And in the middle was Manaus. Thus that city fluked its way into a worldwide monopoly on rubber production.\\nLocal land-owners—we might call them “Rubber Barons”—got rich quick, and then some. And amidst the riotous luxury of life at the top—Manaus was said to lead the world in both diamond-purchasing and brothel-patronizing—a few noble and lasting structures were created, such as the Manaus Opera House. When that grand edifice was completed in 1896, it ranked as one of the largest theaters in the world.\\nYet then came nemesis for Manaus. Just as the folks there were living it up, their competitive advantage was winding down. Or, more precisely, it was sailing away across the Pacific, gone to Asia.\\nIn 1876, a wily British agriculturalist, Henry Wickham, came to Manaus and left with 70,000 Hevea seeds. His goal was profitable nationalism; he would take the seeds to a British colony and plant them there, so that rubber production could thrive under the Union Jack, not under the mostly green-and-yellow flag of Brazil.\\nIt took a few decades to get the hang of rubber-growing in a non-native climate, but soon enough, British planters succeeded in growing rubber in two of their colonies, Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Malaya (Malaysia).\\nIndeed the British, with their superior sense of industry, had actually improved on the Brazilians. Whereas in Manaus the rubber workers simply went out into the wild looking for trees to tap, the Brits established efficient rubber plantations.\\nThus Brazil lost its monopoly profits. By 1910, Brazilian production had fallen to 50 percent of the world market; by 1918, it was down to 20 percent, and in 1940, it was barely more than one percent. Manaus’ opera-house-building days were over. (Since then, of course, synthetic rubber, a technology pioneered in the U.S. during World War Two, has taken over.)\\nOkay, so there you have the doomsday scenario: Silicon Valley could end up suffering the fate of Manaus, with the Chinese today playing the role of the British yesterday.\\nVirgil is not arguing that Silicon Valley could become another Manaus as the Chinese eat our lunch—at least not right away. Yet over time, as we have seen, anything can happen. Just as world history is full of rich empires that have fallen by the wayside—from ancient Egypt to dear old Rome—so, too, it is full of rich economies that fell, and couldn’t get up.\\nOf course, some will insist that the similarities between Manaus, then, and Silicon Valley, now, are much less than the dissimilarities. That is, they insist, It can’t happen here.\\nTo which there’s only thing to say: We’ll find out.\\nAnd of this much, Virgil is sure: The world has not seen its last Ozymandias.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

(He did not mention that it is the N.R.A. that is precipitating such court rulings by suing the State of Florida over its new gun purchasing age.)\\nThe president’s retreat is a stark reminder — if anyone in Washington needed one — that the gun debate remains stuck where it has been for more than a decade. Despite scores of deaths from mass shootings in that time, Republican lawmakers fear the N.R.A.’s ability to stir up opposition in their districts. They continue to oppose new gun restrictions, and even a Republican president with an unconventional approach is unlikely to challenge the status quo in an election year.\\n“I think it is a really disappointing retreat after all the reality-show rhetoric,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview on Monday. Mr. Blumenthal, whose represents the state where 20 children were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School, said the president “has taken his plan from the N.R.A. playbook.”\\nIn the face of N.R.A. opposition, the president has also retreated from his earlier openness to expanded background checks and a renewal of the expired ban on assault weapons — positions that he signaled during a remarkable meeting with lawmakers in which he demanded “comprehensive” legislation that would include longstanding Democratic efforts to restrict firearms.\\nInstead, Mr. Trump over the weekend released a modest plan that eschewed gun control measures in favor of more limited bills that would provide weapons training for teachers and create a commission to study other responses to school shootings.\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

On Monday, she accused the president of having “completely caved to the gun lobby.”\\nThe idea of arming teachers is vigorously opposed by many members of both parties, law enforcement officials and groups representing the nation’s teachers. But it has been pushed for years by the N.R.A., which argues that arming school officials is the best way to protect students and teachers against a well-armed attacker. “The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun,” the N.R.A. mantra has gone.\\nThe White House on Sunday proposed creating the Federal Commission on School Safety, which would study the question of raising the minimum age for purchasing rifles. That proposal came just a day after Mr. Trump himself mocked the idea of federal commissions as ineffective.\\n“We can’t just keep setting up blue-ribbon committees,” Mr. Trump said during a political rally on Saturday. The president said that members of such commissions do little more than “talk, talk, talk” and then, “two hours later, then they write a report.”\\nOn Capitol Hill, the energy has largely dissipated for the kind of expansive gun control legislation that Mr. Trump appeared to support earlier this month. With such legislation stalled, Republican leaders are instead turning their attention toward less contentious measures that would beef up security at the nation’s schools.\\nPhoto\\nThe only gun-related measure that appears to stand a chance of passage this year is the so-called Fix NICS Act, a narrow N.R.A.-backed bill that would improve data reporting to the national background check database. The House has already passed it, as part of a broader bill that includes one of the N.R.A.’s highest priorities: a sharp expansion of the right to carry concealed weapons almost anywhere in the country.\\nThe Senate’s chief sponsor of Fix NICS, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chamber’s No. 2 Republican, said in an interview last week that he had not spoken to the N.R.A. about it. He sees the bill as a way to bridge the partisan divide, though critics note that it would only enforce existing law.\\n“It really to me is simple,” Mr. Cornyn said. “Do people want their whole laundry list of things done and end up empty-handed? That’s what usually happens. If you say, ‘I want 100 percent of what I want or nothing,’ we invariably end up with nothing.”\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nBut even Fix NICS is stuck. The bill has 61 co-sponsors in addition to Mr. Cornyn — two more than the 60 votes required to break a Senate filibuster. But at least two Republicans, and possibly a third, are blocking the Republican leadership from bringing the bill to the floor quickly for a vote.\\nSchool safety measures, meanwhile, are moving forward. The Republican-controlled House is expected to vote Wednesday on the STOP School Violence Act, which would authorize $50 million annually for safety improvements, including training teachers and students in how to prevent violence and developing anonymous reporting systems for threats of school violence.\\nIn the Senate, a companion bill would also give schools money for physical improvements, such as metal detectors or bulletproof windows and doors.\\nAnd even if Senate leaders were inclined to bring up gun legislation for a vote, they are short on time. This week, the Senate is considering a measure to ease banking regulations, and next week senators will be working against a deadline to pass a catchall spending measure to fund the government; the current spending bill expires on March 23. After that, the Senate will be in recess for two weeks.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

But it\\'s not quite medical marijuana.\\nThe strawberry-flavored syrup is a purified form of a chemical ingredient found in the cannabis plant — but not the one that gets users high. It\\'s not yet clear why the ingredient, called cannabidiol, or CBD, reduces seizures in some people with epilepsy.\\nBritish drugmaker GW Pharmaceuticals studied the drug in more than 500 children and adults with hard-to-treat seizures, overcoming numerous legal hurdles that have long stymied research into cannabis.\\nFDA officials said the drug reduced seizures when combined with older epilepsy drugs.\\nThe FDA has previously approved synthetic versions of another cannabis ingredient for medical use, including severe weight loss in patients with HIV.\\nEpidiolex is essentially a pharmaceutical-grade version CBD oil, which some parents already use to treat children with epilepsy. CBD is one of more than 100 chemicals found in marijuana. But it doesn\\'t contain THC, the ingredient that gives marijuana its mind-altering effect.\\nPhysicians say it\\'s important to have a consistent, government-regulated version.\\n\"I\\'m really happy we have a product that will be much cleaner and one that I know what it is,\" said Dr. Ellaine Wirrell, director of the Mayo Clinic\\'s program for childhood epilepsy. \"In the artisanal products there\\'s often a huge variation in doses from bottle to bottle depending on where you get it.\"\\nSide effects with the drug include diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue and sleep problems.\\nSeveral years ago, Allison Hendershot considered relocating her family to Colorado, one of the first states to legalize marijuana and home to a large network of CBD producers and providers. Her 13-year-old daughter, Molly, has suffered from severe seizures since she was 4 months old. But then Hendershot learned about a trial of Epidiolex at New York University.\\n\"I preferred this to some of those other options because it\\'s is a commercial product that has gone through rigorous testing,\" said Hendershot, who lives in Rochester, New York.\\nSince receiving Epidiolex, Hendershot says her daughter has been able to concentrate more and has had fewer \"drop\" seizures — in which her entire body goes limp and collapses.\\nCBD oil is currently sold online and in specialty shops across the U.S., though its legal status remains murky. Most producers say their oil is made from hemp, a plant in the cannabis family that contains little THC and can be legally farmed in a number of states for clothing, food and other uses.\\nThe immediate impact of Monday\\'s approval on these products is unclear.\\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb suggested the agency would be scrutinizing CBD products with \"uncertain dosages and formulations.\"\\n\"We are prepared to take action when we see the illegal marketing of CBD-containing products with serious, unproven medical claims,\" Gottlieb said in a statement.\\nThe FDA previously issued warnings to CBD producers that claimed their products could treat specific diseases, such as cancer or Alzheimer\\'s. Only products that have received formal FDA approval can make such claims, typically requiring clinical trials costing millions.\\nMost CBD producers sidestep the issue by making only broad claims about general health and well-being.\\nIndustry supporters downplayed the impact of the FDA approval.\\n\"I don\\'t know a mom or dad in their right mind who is going to change what\\'s already working,\" said Heather Jackson, CEO of Realm of Caring, a charitable group affiliated with Colorado-based CW Hemp, one of nation\\'s largest CBD companies. \"I really don\\'t think it\\'s going to affect us much.\"\\nJackson\\'s group estimates the typical family using CBD to treat childhood epilepsy spends about $1,800 per year on the substance.\\nA GW Pharmaceuticals spokeswoman said the company would not immediately announce a price for the drug, which it expects to launch in the fall. Wall Street analysts have previously predicted it could cost $25,000 per year, with annual sales eventually reaching $1 billion.\\nFor their part, GW Pharmaceuticals executives say they are not trying to disrupt products already on the market. The company has pushed legislation in several states to make sure its drug can be legally sold and prescribed.\\nThe FDA approval for Epidiolex is technically limited to patients with Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, two rare forms of epilepsy for which there are few treatments. But doctors will have the option to prescribe it for other uses.\\nThe new medication enters an increasingly complicated legal environment for marijuana.\\nNine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use. Another 20 states allow medical marijuana, but the U.S. government continues to classify it as a controlled substance with no medical use, in the same category as heroin and LSD.\\nDespite increasing acceptance, there is little rigorous research on the benefits and harms of marijuana. Last year a government-commissioned group concluded that the lack of scientific information about marijuana and CBD poses a risk to public health.\\nBefore sales of Epidiolex can begin, the Drug Enforcement Administration must formally reclassify CBD into a different category of drugs that have federal medical approval.\\nGW Pharmaceuticals makes the drug in the U.K. from cannabis plants that are specially bred to contain high levels of CBD. And the company plans to continue importing the medicine, bypassing onerous U.S. regulations on manufacturing restricted substances.\\n———\\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\\'s Department of Science Education.

In nearly all of them their voices are breaking, they scream with rage, then they pause to gulp air and weep. They are riding the thinnest crest of a wave between abject grief, righteous anger and political will, seeming at any point as if they may by dumped by the weight of their own emotion. Yet despite this, they are able to argue their case in simple terms and identify the weakest link in the oft-perfected Republican script following a mass shooting.\\nPerhaps the most crucial thing that makes them effective advocates for change is the belief that change is possible\\nAt a televised debate, for example, when Marco Rubio tried his usual “this is a tough issue, gun control won’t stop someone like this” spiel, student Cameron Kasky was meticulous. He first lavished praise on the senator for showing up and then asked him, repeatedly, whether he would refuse money from the NRA. It immediately exposed Rubio’s fraudulence, using sympathetic language with the students while still taking donations from rabid gun advocates. Rubio couldn’t find a workable response as jeers rang round the stadium.\\nMost shootings like this stay in the news for a few days, normally accompanied by a half-hearted gun control debate, before falling further and further down homepages. So how have these students been able to progress this issue when so many before them have failed?\\nPart of the reason is demographics: none of the children killed in the Sandy Hook school shooting of 2012 were over seven years old; these are middle-class students preparing for college. Their school was a place where political debate was encouraged, and there had been plenty of on-campus debates about gun rights when it was still an abstract issue for most of the students.\\nOf course, many of America’s most effective pieces of activism have come from its most disenfranchised citizens, but as Trevor Noah, host of the Daily Show, put it: “A lot of these kids come from wealthy backgrounds. The school in Parkland is in an affluent neighbourhood … This is people using their privilege, if that makes sense. Because these kids are like, ‘No, I don’t accept this world.’ And the parents and the politicians are like, ‘Well that’s not how it works.’ And they’re like, ‘Well you need to change it. I don’t care. I want to see the manager.’”\\nBoth the media and the students themselves have suggested that the reason they’re being listened to is because they have grown up digital natives and they have been able to harness the power of social media. While it’s true that internet access will have exposed them to the power and techniques of activism, it does these teenagers a disservice to say they are merely wily online operatives. If anything, their success has been to avoid keeping protest inside echo chambers on Twitter and Snapchat, and reach out to normal Americans on TV news and mainstream shows like Ellen and the Today Show. Even in Britain, they have been a constant feature of Radio 4 news shows and the evening news on every channel. They have shrewdly understood that all media outlets are all hungry for access to the victims, and if they are willing to sacrifice their right to private grieving, there will not be a shortage of places willing to give them a platform.\\nAnother smart move was to set the date of their planned nationwide anti-gun protest more than a month after the shooting, giving the story an extended news cycle and infuriating the gun lobby which had hoped that national anger would dissipate as it had in the past.\\nBut perhaps the most crucial thing that makes them effective advocates for change is the basic belief that change is possible. One of the defining malaises of our age is the feeling that we can do nothing about the horrors we are exposed to every day. The American psychologist Martin Seligman called it “learned helplessness”, the documentarian Adam Curtis called it “oh dearism” – it is a feeling that intensifies over decades of repeated failures: if you have seen enough cases of police brutality, or horrifying wars in the Middle East or mass shootings you start to believe that nothing will ever change.\\nThese students are not only too young to have lived through the many times this has happened before, they have also grown up in an era of radical change: the first black president, the first president with no political experience, the legalisation of gay marriage and, yes, the rise of social media and its ability to give a voice to anyone. They have not yet succumbed to the idea that nothing can be done.\\nOprah compares Florida shooting activists to civil rights pioneers Read more\\nOne of their most popular chants, heard at rallies and vigils, ringing around the American news channels and no doubt in the White House, is “we have a voice”. On paper it seems like an odd phrase: it’s non-specific, it doesn’t demand anything of any power like most protest slogans do. But when you see it spat from the mouths of otherwise peaceful young people, you realise it’s not aimed at any one lawmaker, but the fabric of reality itself.\\nThese survivors are experiencing their agency, destroying the very deep psychological barrier that says no person can change certain inalienable truths about American politics, reminding themselves that every great change in history happened just after a thousand missed opportunities when things stayed exactly the same.\\n• Sam Wolfson is a freelance journalist\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Clean energy offers billions in potential investment and thousands of jobs for regional Queensland. But it also faces on-the-ground challenges, including turf wars with intensive farming that threaten to hamper the energy sector’s transition.\\nSign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon\\nAsh’s decision to offer up part of his Mirani property for solar has made him something of a divisive figure locally. Two fellow growers objected, as did the company that buys and refines his cane, Mackay Sugar. Mackay regional council, whose planning officers had backed the project, voted to reject the application. Legal action is afoot.\\nWhenever he’s asked about the state of the sugar industry or the challenges faced by cane growers, Ash just makes a downward motion with his arm.\\nHe wanders around his block, pointing to patches of standover cane – left unharvested from the previous season – where solar panels will ultimately be placed. He says part of the field to be given to the solar company was planted with cane just four years ago.\\n“If I had my time over again I wouldn’t have planted it, the way the industry has gone,” Ash says. “When [the solar plan] come around, the way the industry was going, it was going backwards and it was one way of diversifying into something that’s friendly, it’s not going to do harm.\\n“And if it doesn’t work, well, they’ll reinstate the ground back to how it was. You’re not putting it under cement or doing that sort of thing.”\\n‘It’s a very sunny place’\\nModelling released by the Climate Institute last year showed Queensland had the potential to power 4m homes through renewable energy projects and create more than 7,000 jobs over the next decade, many of them in north and central Queensland where many local economies are struggling with high unemployment and the hit-and-miss legacies of mining and gas booms. The number of jobs on offer is considerably more than at Adani’s Carmichael coalmine, a project touted by many in these parts as an economic saviour.\\nAndrew Stock, an energy expert and councillor for the Climate Council, says about $1.6bn of renewable investment is being built in Queensland.\\n“Obviously ... it’s a very sunny place so solar projects both large and small, are very well suited to Queensland and north Queensland,” he says. “The amount of energy they can generate ... is among the highest output of any solar farms in Australia.”\\nThe clean energy regulator says the government’s 2020 renewable energy target has effectively been met by projects either built or under construction. Incentives have led to an industry boom but there is a danger it will shift to bust without changes to policy settings and planning regulations that could threaten the pace of the renewable transition.\\nStock says the federal government’s national energy guarantee is “woefully inadequate” and will bring forward no new renewable energy capacity over the next decade.\\n“If electricity demand doesn’t grow, and no existing coal plants shut, the modelling by the energy security board last year shows there are virtually no new renewables ... that need to be built,” he says.\\n“And that’s potentially a problem for renewables, that pipeline of investment projects, probably between $7bn to $10bn worth of investment, many thousands of jobs ... and that’s all put at risk because under the Neg, the emissions reduction requirements mean that there’s virtually no new renewable capacity that’s needed.”\\nFrom overhead, the cane fields are a mesmerising combination of bright green and right angles, stretching for country miles. About 300km to the north of Mirani, near the banks of the Burdekin River, patterned rows of black panels suddenly consume the landscape.\\nThe Clare solar farm is the state’s largest, and last month was connected to the energy grid. In 2015 it caused angst among cane growers and was subject to a legal challenge led by the local milling company, Wilmar, until being “called in” by the state government, a process that overrides local planners on matters of state significance.\\nThe same conflict between sugar and solar has been repeated at Mirani, and will be again.\\n“The Queensland government has a very strong policy of supporting solar renewables in general,” says Georgina Davis, senior policy adviser for the Queensland Farmers’ Federation. “They didn’t make provision to plan where they would go. They’ve let that be a market-driven process.\\n“It’s just been an unfortunate sort of effect that some of those sites have been on [good quality] agricultural land. Their primary focus is looking for a piece of land that has a willing seller or a willing renter, and that has the access to infrastructure they need.”\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Part of the huge solar farm at Clare. Photograph: Jack Tran\\nSolar projects are more efficient, and more profitable, the closer they are built to existing substations, which means proponents have targeted certain blocks. The Australian Energy Market Operator issues ratings called “marginal loss factors” which score renewable projects based on local demand and effectively determine how much energy that project can feed into the grid.\\n“The adoption and interest in large-scale solar has been so quick, and it has had to be quick,” Davis says. “A lot of them have been in a rush to get these facilities up compared to their competitors ... Once that capacity is gone, it’s gone.”\\nAlthough the operation of the energy market has exacerbated land-use conflicts, planning policies also lack consistency when it comes to land disputes between agriculture and renewables.\\nThe Queensland state planning policy lists enabling renewable energy projects as a priority. It also aims to minimise “encroachment on agricultural resources to ensure viable tracts of agricultural land are maintained”.\\nThe farmers’ federation and the farm lobby group AgForce have called for a solar code that provides protection for high-quality land and establishes rehabilitation bonds, similar to those for mining tenements. Graziers are worried about the effect of power lines connecting some facilities, and farmers are in some cases uncomfortable that they are close to projects.\\n‘The industry has got a lot to prove yet’\\nThe Mackay mayor, Greg Williamson, says his council would have supported a solar farm proposal had it been on “rubbish land” but state policies required it to consider the agricultural impacts.\\n“It doesn’t matter whether it’s the one that’s being contested now or not,” he says. “If it’s growing 9,000 to 10,000 tonne of cane a year and it [is good quality agricultural land], we’re obliged to consider that. And really nothing else trumps it.”\\nEven if state government policy did not mandate the consideration of agricultural land, the council’s priority is sugar, rather than solar, Williamson says. The council has “nothing against solar” and considered building its own solar farm, but found ultimately it would not produce savings to justify the investment. Instead, the region is putting panels at individual council sites.\\n“We don’t want a future for our industry to be less cane farms and to grow solar panels,” he says. “We want more sugar to be produced. We want to grow more sugar for the right outcomes.”\\nStock says communities such as Mackay, which is a hub for the Bowen basin’s coalmines, should be among the first to embrace the opportunities provided by renewables. They should “start to plan that transition in an orderly way so they don’t end up being faced with really quite dramatic shocks to regional employment when mines close”.\\nWilliamson, who argues that Australia should have invested in new coal-fired power stations, bristles at that suggestion.\\n“Well, mate, hang on,” he says. “Queensland generates 14.8 gigawatts of power to run every day and less than 5% has been generated by solar. The industry has got a lot to prove yet.\\n“From a council perspective, we have an industry [sugar] that produces $400m to $500m a year for our valley, for our region ... It is not fair to level at council a head-in-the-sand attitude about renewable energy ... when we have a vested interest in protecting an industry that provides millions and millions of dollars to this district.”\\nFor Colin Ash, that same industry, the one he’s worked in for a lifetime, is getting to the point where he’s struggling to make ends meet. Like many other growers he has everything – his income, and his ability to fund his retirement – invested in the land.\\n“It’s not a goldmine what they’re offering [for the solar development],” he says. “When this come along, that was one way of putting a bit of a buffer in there, without the cost of diversifying into something else.\\n“It was clean, green, and no trouble to go back to any other agriculture afterwards if it doesn’t work.\\n“You just can’t get sentimental about these things.”\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

But it also has a homeless crisis and an affordable housing problem.\\nTo help alleviate both, the Seattle City Council is weighing a proposal to impose a new tax on big businesses.\\nThe proposed tax amounts to 26 cents per working hour per employee in Seattle. That works out to roughly $540 a year for every full-time employee.\\nOnly businesses that generate at least $20 million of annual revenue in Seattle itself would be subject to the tax.\\nThe legislation would affect less than 3% of employers in the city, or about 585 businesses, according to Councilmember M. Lorena Gonzalez, a co-sponsor of the legislation.\\nRelated: Good luck buying a home in Seattle\\nLast fall, the council rejected a similar \"head\" tax proposal that would have raised less money but would have affected more companies.\\nThe proposed tax is expected to raise $75 million a year, three quarters of which would be used to build roughly 1,800 affordable housing units. The other quarter would be spent on emergency and shelter services for the homeless.\\nBy 2021, the per-head tax would convert to a 0.7% payroll tax and still raise $75 million, according to materials from the Council.\\nAmazon could pay $20 million or more a year\\nThe company that likely would owe the most under such a tax is Amazon, Seattle\\'s largest private sector employer. It employs more than 45,000 people in the city. If the proposed tax goes into effect, Amazon could be subject to a head tax north of $20 million a year.\\nAmazon, which declined to comment on the proposal, notes that it already contributes economically in many ways to Seattle. For example, it will provide a permanent location for a shelter in one of its new office buildings by 2020. It would be run by the nonprofit Mary\\'s Place, which already had temporary use of two vacant Amazon buildings to shelter the homeless since 2016.\\nStarbucks did not respond to a request for comment.\\nRelated: Typical Amazon employee makes less than you think\\nProsperous big businesses can in turn generate a lot of economic activity and revenue for their host city. And they may donate goods, services or money to critical social causes.\\nBut the co-sponsors of the bill note that a major cause of homelessness is the higher cost of housing that results when more workers move to a city for jobs that pay more than long-time residents have been earning. And the demand to build affordable housing doesn\\'t keep pace.\\n\"A progressive tax on businesses most benefiting from this growth is our best option because we already rely heavily upon regressive property and sales taxes that hit everyone equally,\" Councilmember Lisa Herbold said in a statement.\\nProperty and sales taxes are the city\\'s main source of revenue since Seattle does not have an income tax. Businesses there also pay a business and occupancy tax.\\nCritics of the Council proposal, however, say it\\'s a tax on jobs that could curb growth.\\nWhile a head tax isn\\'t unheard of, \"they are rare, and for good reason: most cities recognize that it\\'s not in the best interest to penalize employment,\" said Jared Wolczak, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation.\\nCertainly a tax that is seen as too onerous could influence a company\\'s behavior, noted Tax Policy Center researcher Richard Auxier. But it\\'s also true that a company locates itself in a place for more reasons than taxes, Auxier added. For instance, a business has a better chance of prospering in a socially stable city with good infrastructure, good schools and an educated workforce.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Here are the real facts:\\n———\\nNOT REAL: American Restaurant Granted Permission to Sell Dog Meat!\\nTHE FACTS: A long-circulated false article about a California restaurant putting canine flesh on its menu offers this new twist: the sales are going forward as a court considers whether selling dishes of dog is protected in the U.S. as part of freedom of religion. But the Los Angeles County public health department says there\\'s no such restaurant there called Puchow de Manila Eatery and Fine Dining, and they noted it\\'s illegal in the state to sell dog meat for human consumption. The most recent version of the story, which has circulated since at least 2014, alleges an unnamed \"Filipino group\" asked an unspecified Supreme Court to lift the ban because it violated members\\' religious rights. The article on the grandemeli site said that in the meantime, the restaurant had \"provisional permission\" to serve the meat. The site couldn\\'t be reached for comment, as it published no contact information and registered the page through a third-party service.\\n———\\nNOT REAL: The U.S. District Attorney Has Announced That He Will Be Pursuing Charges of Treason Against the Former President Barack Obama\\nTHE FACTS: A website is recirculating an inaccurate story claiming an FBI official announced he\\'s investigating former President Barack Obama for treason. The latest version of the story appeared on a site called webviners. It alleged FBI general counsel Dana Boente will pursue such charges, but Boente never made such an announcement. Also, the piece incorrectly identified him as \"the U.S. District Attorney.\" The article also erred in claiming Obama demoted Boente at some unspecified time during his administration, removing him from a Justice Department position that was second in line behind the attorney general, and that President Donald Trump reversed that action. Obama nominated Boente in 2015 to lead federal prosecutions in Virginia\\'s eastern district, and Boente remained in that job through the rest of Obama\\'s term. After Trump took office in January 2017, the new president brought Boente to the Justice Department in Washington, where he has served in several senior roles. He officially left the prosecutor\\'s job in Virginia in October. The webviners site administrators could not be reached for comment.\\n———\\nNOT REAL: Million Pounds Of Rat Meat Being Sold As Chicken Wings In U.S.\\nTHE FACTS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration hasn\\'t issued a warning to consumers about 1 million pounds of rat meat being sold as boneless chicken wings and officials didn\\'t seize any such meat from China at the Port of San Francisco. Such claims have circulated on social media for more than a year. The latest version appeared on the Gun Society site. In an email this week, FDA spokesman Peter Cassell said the story isn\\'t true.

And in the joint agreement, it is Trump rather than the U.S. which is the party guaranteeing North Korea’s regime safety. This is diplomacy for the kindergarten.”\\nChosun‘s editorial called the results of the meeting “the worst outcome for South Korea” and applauded Kim Jong-un’s “incredible achievement” of getting a U.S. president to meet with him without yielding any “major concessions.”\\n“A closer look at the joint agreement shows it was Kim who ended up taking home the prize. It is simply unbelievable that Trump flew all the way to Singapore to end up with the short end of the stick,” an outraged Chosun concludes.\\nIn addition to its own voice, Chosun magnified that of skeptics who felt that the language in the Trump-Kim declaration was too soft to ensure that North Korea, which has serially broken international agreements, would adhere to it. Chosun has consistently throughout 2018 championed the voices of North Korean refugees and defectors who have demanded that world leaders keep the horrific human rights abuses of the Kim regime front and center in negotiations.\\nSeveral professors told Chosun Ilbo they believe the deal worsens the North Korean problem.\\n“With the latest agreement, we can kiss goodbye to the prospect of North Korean denuclearization,” Nam Sung-wook at Korea University told the newspaper. Park Won-gon of Handong Global University called the meeting the “scam of the century.”\\nThe voices condemning the meeting are largely minority voices in South Korea, a fact punctuated Wednesday by regional elections that saw the ruling leftist Democratic Party sweep so definitively that Hong and other minority party leaders are expected to resign. Public sentiment about engaging Kim Jong-un has swung dramatically throughout 2018, first dropping significantly in January following the presence of a North Korean delegation at the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, then picking up after Moon Jae-in met Kim personally. By late May, 78 percent of South Korean respondents told the Korea Research Center that they trusted Kim Jong-un to make a deal on denuclearization.\\nThe deal that Kim and Trump agreed to in Singapore Tuesday means the end of “war games” between South Korea and the United States, which often simulate the invasion of North Korea. President Trump called the exercises “provocative” and told reporters they would end, a promise he made following his meeting with Kim. South Korean government officials tentatively said Tuesday that “we need to figure out President Trump’s accurate meaning and intention of this comment.”\\nOn Wednesday, the South Korean presidential office issued a more concrete statement, saying, “We believe there is a need to consider various ways to further promote dialogue as long as serious discussions are being held between the United States and North Korea for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and establishment of peace.”\\nIn addition to a promise to work towards “complete” denuclearization, Kim promised in the joint declaration with Trump that he would repatriate the remains of Americans killed during the Korean War.\\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

That agreement outlined provisions for a cease-fire and other measures to resolve the conflict.\\nThe war, which erupted after the Russian annexation of Crimea, continues to impact U.S. relations with Russia and prompt many Western leaders to question Russian President Vladimir Putin\\'s wider intentions in Eastern Europe.\\nBBC correspondent Jonah Fisher describes the situation in Ukraine as \"a simmering conflict\" with no end in sight, characterized by frequent cross-border shelling.\\n\"The front line between the Ukrainian government forces and the Russian-backed rebel forces really hasn\\'t moved substantially over the last few years,\" he tells Here & Now\\'s Meghna Chakrabarti. \"It\\'s still a conflict which is being fought on the ground, but it\\'s not a conflict really that either side seems to think it can win.\"\\nThe USS Navy destroyer Carney arrived in Ukrainian waters this week as part of American efforts to support the Ukrainian government. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, while the U.S. and Europe have not provided significant military support to Ukraine, the ongoing conflict has damaged the prospects of collaborating with Russia on terrorism, arms control and the Syrian conflict.\\nIn December, the Trump administration announced that it would start sending lethal weapons to Ukraine to support their forces fighting in the eastern part of the country, which sparked criticism from Russia, Fisher says.\\n\"It\\'s pretty rich really coming from the Russians considering it\\'s almost accepted by almost everyone that the Russians are ... providing the support and indeed much of the manpower to the rebels in the eastern part of Ukraine,\" he says. \"On the ground, it\\'s not going to really shift the balance of power, but the Ukrainians are certainly pleased that the Americans have sort of increased their commitment to them.\"\\nThe Trump administration has sent mixed messages on Russia\\'s role in Ukraine, but in December, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was clear about the U.S. commitment to Ukraine.\\n\"Russia\\'s taking sovereign territory of Ukraine is something that we will never accept,\" Tillerson said at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [OSCE] summit in Vienna. \"And we appreciate the strong solidarity of European partners in standing up on behalf of Ukraine to restore their sovereign territory to them.\"\\nRussian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has blamed Ukraine for the stalemate in efforts to reach a peace agreement.\\n\"The whole responsibility lies with Ukrainian authorities,\" he said in his speech at the OSCE.\\nThe United Nations Human Rights Council estimates more than 1.6 million people have been internally displaced by the conflict, and for the nearly 3 million that remain living near the front lines, the humanitarian crisis is increasingly dire.\\nAlexander Hug, deputy chief monitor in Ukraine for OSCE, told NPR last August that those caught in the crossfire are struggling to survive with little power, heat or running water.\\n\"They are not in tanks and in armored vehicles,\" he said. \"They are in their houses, in their beds. They are on the streets and in their gardens and they are fully exposed to these risks, and that has to be acknowledged.

The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 declined 1.3% apiece.\\nTrump\\'s controversial tariff announcement caught investors off guard and immediately raised concerns about retaliation from China or other major U.S. trading partners.\\n\"This is the first shot across the bow over a trade war,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR. \"And nobody wins a trade war.\"\\nTrump said his administration would impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum. It was not immediately clear whether Trump would exempt some countries from the tariffs, as his national security advisers have urged him to do to avoid hurting U.S. allies.\\nCorporate America has warned Trump that tariffs could backfire. Last month, the Business Roundtable warned of the risk of \"foreign retaliation\" that would \"harm the U.S. economy.\"\\nInvestors will be looking to see how U.S. trading partners react to the tariffs.\\nBeyond worries about retaliation, the tariff news drove concerns about rising costs for companies that rely heavily on aluminum and steel, like auto and plane makers. Imports make up about a third of the steel American businesses use every year, and more than 90% of aluminum used here. Shares of Boeing (BA) fell 3% General Motors (GM) dipped 4%, and Ford (F) dropped 3%.\\nRelated: NY Fed chief: Tariffs risk \\'trade war\\'\\nIf the tariffs result in higher prices on steel and aluminum, companies that rely on those products may pass on some of the costs to consumers. That raises the specter of creeping inflation.\\n\"This clearly will [lead to] higher prices in the production chain, which is part of the inflation path,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\\nThe timing of the tariff news surprised Wall Street. A formal announcement was expected at some point Thursday, but then it was called off. Later, Trump mentioned his tariff plans in a hastily arranged listening session with steel and aluminum executives. And he didn\\'t provide crucial details, such as whether certain countries will be exempted.\\nConcerns about trade come at an already shaky time on Wall Street. The S&P 500 and Dow fell about 4% in February, their worst month in two years. Fears about inflation and soaring bond yields caused a surge in volatility, including two 1,000-point plunges for the Dow.\\nThe market had come back as investors focused on the strong economy and booming corporate profits. But stocks fell sharply again on Tuesday and Wednesday, putting the Dow back in negative territory for the year.\\nTurbulence has picked up as well. The VIX (VIX) volatility index spiked 15% on Thursday. Selling pressure will climb as volatility increases, Krosby said.\\nAt least two corners of the stock market cheered Trump\\'s tariff announcement. U.S. Steel (X) and AK Steel (AKS)soared 6% and 10%, respectively.\\nCentury Aluminum (CENX) also spiked 7%. Another major aluminum maker, Alcoa (AA), gained 1%.\\nTrump\\'s tariff moves could force investors to confront another trade issue: NAFTA. Trump has repeatedly threatened to tear up this major trade deal with Canada and Mexico. Talks to renegotiate NAFTA, a major piece of the U.S. economy, have so far failed to produce a solution.\\n\"It sets off the protectionist fears that had been lying dormant,\" said Hogan.\\n— CNN\\'s Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

I could never thank my attorneys enough for fighting endlessly to prove my innocence and bring me home.”\\nAccording to Overton’s attorney, Cynthia Orr, the Texas comptroller told Overton on Tuesday that she would receive a check for $573,333.33 as compensation her for her wrongful incarceration. She is also qualified to receive insurance and education benefits. Beginning next year, she will also receive an annuity.\\n“I am over the moon that Hannah has been granted compensation by Texas for her wrongful imprisonment,” Orr told ABC News. “She and her family do so much good with nothing. This small benefit will allow her and her sweet family to continue to share their goodness with all of us with some degree of comfort. It is a small thing for one who has suffered so greatly.\"\\nHannah Overton, who has long maintained her innocence, spent seven years in prison for the young child’s death.

That official statement granted her access to state funds that are provided to the wrongfully convicted and also prevented her from being tried for the crime again.\\nOverton was convicted of capital murder after being accused of force-feeding Burd enough sodium to kill him. The prosecution portrayed her as a mother who had lost control and tried to punish the young boy by giving him seasoning mixed in water. At the time, Overton had four children and was pregnant with a fifth, and had no prior trouble with the law.\\nTodd Yates/Corpus Christi Caller-Times/AP\\nThe defense presented the jury with a medical mystery. They speculated Andrew might have had pica, an eating disorder characterized by an obsessive appetite and that Andrew accidentally poisoned himself by consuming a fatal amount of sodium.\\nLarry Overton was also charged with murder, but after his wife\\'s conviction, he was offered a plea deal and was given probation. After he completed his probation, the charges were dismissed.\\nOverton was released on bond in December 2014 after a Texas appellate court overturned her conviction and life sentence. But former Nueces County District Attorney Mark Skurka charged Overton a second time for murder after her release.\\nKeith Hissong\\nThose charges were not considered double jeopardy because Overton’s conviction was overturned by the higher court on the basis of ineffective counsel, which granted her a new trial. Overton\\'s original trial attorneys admitted at an appeals hearing that they had made errors.\\nSkurka ended up dropping the new case against her in 2015 but Overton remained in legal limbo until Gonzalez officially declared her innocence last year, thus closing a significant chapter on this decade-long case.\\n\"After further review of all the evidence and meeting with her defense attorneys and everyone involved, my office decided that we\\'re going to dismiss the case and include language in there that would actually indicate that she\\'s not guilty of the charge that we charged her with, or the previous administration,\" Gonzalez said at the time.\\nKeith Hissong\\nThe Overtons live in East Texas and told ABC News they have housed and supported prisoners after their release through their non-profit organization, Syndeo Ministries.\\n“I also could never begin to thank those who supported us, prayed and prayed for us, and walked with us along the entire way,” Overton said.\\nShana Druckerman contributed to this report\\n\\n### Response:\\n######\\n1.

Rick Wilking/Reuters\\nPro-Trump pundits Diamond and Silk faced questions about their relationship to the Trump campaign at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday, and their answers led to suggestions they had lied under oath.\\nThe duo may not have been forthcoming in their answers—and they may have yelled a lot— but there looks to be more nuance to the situation than it initially appeared.\\nThe hearing, titled “Filtering Practices of Social Media Platforms,” was called to discuss accusations that Facebook and other social media platforms suppress conservative content. Diamond and Silk’s Facebook page had briefly been labeled “unsafe to the community,” which many Republicans took as proof of censorship despite the company saying it was simply a mistake. That made the duo a popular subject during Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony earlier this month and got them invited to testify on Thursday.\\nDuring the hearing, Texas congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee asked whether Diamond and Silk had ever received money from the Trump campaign.\\nDiamond, whose real name is Lynnette Hardaway, said five times under oath that she had not.\\nLater, New York Congressman Hakeem Jeffries pointed to FEC records that showed the campaign had paid them $1,274.94 for “field consulting.” He reminded them that they would be committing perjury if they lied under oath.\\nSilk, whose real name is Rochelle Richardson, responded, “We’re familiar with that particular lie. We could see that you do look at fake news.”\\nShe then went on to claim that the payment was actually a reimbursement for plane tickets they purchased to fly to a Women for Trump event in Ohio and suggested that the campaign may have made a mistake in their FEC filings.\\nTrump campaign treasurer Bradley Crate sent Slate a statement that supported their version of events:\\nThe issue regarding Diamond and Silk is merely one of semantics, resulting from a reasonable misunderstanding of the Campaign’s reporting obligations. The Campaign’s payment to Diamond and Silk for field consulting was based on an invoice they submitted reflecting their costs for air travel to a Campaign event. The invoice was not supported by accompanying receipts, so as a technical matter, could not be reported as a reimbursement even though its purpose was to make them whole for their out-of-pocket costs.\\nIt’s unclear whether other parts of their testimony were accurate, such as their claims that YouTube had demonetized their videos or that Facebook had intentionally censored them for being conservative, but the discrepancy around payment could reasonably have been caused by the nuances of campaign finance laws.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

He then signed a new law raising the age limit to purchase rifles to 21 and creating a process enabling law-enforcement officers to seize guns from someone who is considered a danger.\\nScott has contended that Nelson has “done nothing” on high-profile issues such as gun violence. Nelson has said Scott has not done enough – he wants universal background checks and a ban on certain types of semi-automatic rifles.\\nMost polls predict a Scott-Nelson race to be close, although according to the realclearpolitics.com average, Nelson holds a lead in most.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

They spotted oil and gas leaks. They inspected damaged cell towers that had left thousands unable to call for help. \"Drones became a literal lifeline,\" former Federal Aviation Administration chief Michael Huerta told the agency\\'s drone advisory committee in November.\\nThe drones used needed a special exemption from a set of FAA rules, known as Part 107, that normally require small drones to fly below 400 feet, stay within the operator\\'s visual line of sight and avoid populated areas.\\nThese regulations make it hard for commercial drones to operate in the United States. But last October the Department of Transportation took a big step: It invited state and local governments to partner with universities and companies on tests to speed the integration of drones into the national airspace. The FAA is reviewing 149 proposals and plans to choose five to 10 by mid-May.\\nThe proposals cover a wide range of applications. Many of them are health-related. \"I am confident that one-half or more of all the applicants have put some element of medical support in their proposal,\" says John Walker, a Lancaster, Penn.-based aerospace consultant who spent 32 years at the FAA before co-founding the Padina Group, Inc in 2006.\\nWalker believes early public acceptance of drone delivery networks in urban areas will revolve around hospitals. And once drones can safely and reliably carry blood and medical supplies, that will pave the way to other kinds of drone deliveries. \"That linear network where drones can operate between hospitals ... would also have Amazon and anyone else that could meet the requirements to operate,\" Walker says.\\nSeveral companies have approached governments in developing countries about performing medical deliveries in areas with great need, poor roads and less crowded skies.\\nIn late 2016 Zipline, a San Francisco Bay Area-based robotics startup, set up distribution centers in Rwanda, where its drones had made more than 1400 flights carrying on-demand blood and emergency supplies over 62,000 miles as of last fall. This year the company will expand its medical delivery operations by launching a second base in Rwanda and new service in a larger neighboring country, Tanzania.\\nLast October Swiss Post launched a medical transport network in Lugano, Switzerland, using drones made by another Bay Area company, Matternet. So far the drones have made 350 deliveries, about 5 to 15 per day. Other groups have also brought aircraft abroad to attempt health-related deliveries, but those demo flights have not become sustained operations.\\nSuch efforts face tougher hurdles here in the U.S. where regulations focus on safely integrating drones into already congested national airspace. \"We haven\\'t seen [the FAA] be interested in a one-off approach,\" says Susan Roberts, co-founder of AiRXOS, a General Electric subsidiary focused on drone infrastructure technologies. \"It doesn\\'t do anybody any good for a delivery company to be able to fly from two specific points if they can\\'t then scale that over and over again.\"\\nBeyond blood and medical supply deliveries, drones could transform another key component of healthcare — lab tests. Timely test results help doctors diagnose infections and reduce guesswork in prescribing medications. Some of those decisions have life-or-death implications. For example, newborn babies turn yellow from jaundice as their bodies make bilirubin, a byproduct formed during normal breakdown of red blood cells. But \"very high bilirubin can be toxic to babies,\" says Dr. Geoff Baird, a clinical pathologist at the University of Washington in Seattle.\\nOf the millions of blood samples, urine specimens and swabs his team processes each year, most reach central lab facilities by car. \"We have cars going seven days a week, many times a day, up and down the state of Washington on freeways, across the passes, in the mountains,\" Baird says. The university also does testing for out-of-state hospitals and several clinics in rural communities on the San Juan Islands off the northwest coast of Washington. Getting lab samples from the islands down to Seattle hospitals for testing requires multiple stops by car, plane and ferry — a journey of about 100 miles that often takes more than 24 hours, even longer on weekends.\\nBut samples carried over the Puget Sound on a drone from the San Juan Islands could reach the main lab in Seattle in 90 minutes, Baird says. That\\'s why the university was eager to put in a bid for the FAA program.\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Johns Hopkins School of Medicine\\nThe proposed medical deliveries are part of a larger application submitted by Washington\\'s Department of Transportation, which includes other companies such as Amazon and T-Mobile. If selected, Baird says the San Juan efforts will use drones developed at Tuscon, Ariz.-based Latitude Engineering. Latitude makes the military-grade aircraft that Johns Hopkins researchers used to set a distance record carrying refrigerated blood samples ~160 miles in a 3-hour flight across the desert.\\nNorth Carolina\\'s Department of Transportation also applied to the FAA program wanting to use drones for medical deliveries. Zipline and Matternet are on that application as well as several other undisclosed proposals. Matternet is also partnering with the city of Palo Alto on a proposal to shuttle blood to Stanford hospitals. Flirtey, a drone manufacturer in Reno, Nev., is focusing on using its aircraft for last-mile delivery of defibrillators — devices the company thinks could save hundreds of thousands of lives in America each year, by increasing the chance of survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\\nUltimately, though, what makes or breaks a proposal isn\\'t likely the whiz-bang drones but rather the underlying infrastructure that ensures they can fly safely alongside commercial jets, helicopters, balloons and everything else in the sky.\\nToward that end, at a drone symposium held earlier this week in Baltimore, the FAA stressed its interest in \"sense and avoid\" technologies to prevent drone crashes, and systems that allow drones to be identified and tracked remotely. GE\\'s projects cover both areas. \"No one company is going to solve everything. We\\'re taking a holistic approach,\" Roberts says. \"We need to help the medical deliveries, we need to help the inspectors, we need to help people who are just taking pictures of houses.\"\\nThe United Nations Children\\'s Fund is working to foster this all-inclusive spirit at the global level. Last summer, UNICEF worked with local governments in the African country of Malawi to launch a drone corridor for companies, universities and nonprofits to fly test missions there.\\nMore recently, UNICEF invited groups to transport vaccines in Vanuatu, the South Pacific nation made up of roughly 80 islands east of Australia. The drone corridors run on a barter system, says Chris Fabian, who leads UNICEF\\'s venture capital arm. \"If you come and use our time, create something that\\'s open-source and useful for everyone else.\"\\nEsther Landhuis is a freelance science journalist in the San Francisco Bay Area.

But many Iranians understand that their country has resources their families never see.\\nTaking to the streets is a high-risk activity in Iran. So it is all the more notable that for the first time people are demonstrating without any purchase on the country’s political establishment. On the contrary: Even reformist politicians have chastised these protesters and suggested they are serving foreign masters.\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

By contrast, in 1999 and 2009 popular protests were largely orchestrated through the reformist faction, an affiliation that provided the demonstrators with leadership, a civil rights agenda that didn’t overflow the bounds of the Constitution, and tactical limits that protesters could breach only at their risk.\\nThis current round of protests, by all accounts, are bound by none of these constraints. They reportedly began as a hard-line assault on Mr. Rouhani but quickly acquired an independent momentum and spontaneously spread. There are no leaders to imprison or publicly humiliate, no democratic agenda to tar by association with Western values and no reason for protesters to avoid disruptive tactics or slogans that antagonize the entire ruling system. These demonstrations don’t pit elites against one another but citizens against the state. Some of the people I know who were active in the 2009 uprising profess to be frightened today — of chaos and the potential for destructive demagogy. Others call for unity in opposition.\\nIf there is one thing Americans should know by now about Iran, it is how little we know it. The Iranian regime, with its heavy-handed censorship and self-isolation, has made sure of this. So has the pitched battle over American foreign policy on Iran, which renders Iran’s domestic realities as talking points in a conversation that is really about us. There is an almost embarrassing cone of silence around today’s protesters. They live in provincial cities, Tehran reformists don’t speak for them and they are not the sorts of people connected with the domestic or international news media. Moreover, their likely demographic has been subject to casual generalizations that turn out to be wrong.\\nFor instance, the conventional wisdom inside and outside Iran has long held that the lower and working classes in Iran were clients of the state and the core hard-line constituency. Kevan Harris, a sociologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, conducted a study of welfare recipients and political affiliation that called this assumption into question. It turns out that loyalty is not so easily bought. Welfare recipients are not more politically predictable than other Iranians. And now it seems that when members of this cohort turn up on Iran’s streets, after years of being told that there is nothing wrong with an economy that can’t keep factory doors open or food on the table, their slogans are more radical than those of the presumptive middle class.\\nAyatollah Khamenei, for his part, has spent these days of rage composing anti-American tweets, warning of an American plot to dismember the country and comparing President Trump unfavorably with Ronald Reagan. This is both deflection and political savvy. Nationalism is a powerful current in Iranian life, and Mr. Trump is offering Ayatollah Khamenei the gift of a credible straw man — with alacrity, it seems. But American sound and fury mainly serve to obfuscate a domestic quandary.\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nEvery decade or so in Iran, protests erupt whose scale, intensity and persistence make global headlines. The ideological punditry flows. We read that the regime is universally hated and about to fall, and then we read that the regime is strong and the oppositionists are marginal people of no account — because, in 2009, they were predominantly middle class, or because, in 2018, they are not. Security forces crack down, the regime doesn’t fall, and dissent remains stalwart and pervasive.\\nA political scientist once told me that Iran is the exception that proves the rule: It’s the textbook example of the country that meets every precondition for democratic transition but still refuses to change.\\nIranian protests repeatedly come down to one thing: the accountability of the regime to its people. But Ayatollah Khamenei has buttered his bread on the other side. His power depends on the continued stranglehold of the security state, which he has also made the country’s economic center of gravity. So long as this is true, he can’t or won’t address the root cause of Iran’s chronic unrest.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

Photograph: Brynn Anderson/AP\\nThe House intelligence committee will on Tuesday question Steve Bannon, the one-time confidant to Donald Trump who has fallen spectacularly from power.\\n'It's all explosive': Michael Wolff on Donald Trump Read more\\nThe House panel is speeding toward a conclusion of its interviews in its investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and alleged collusion between Trump aides and Moscow.\\nBannon lost the backing of key Republican donors and his position at the hard-right Breitbart News after the publication – first reported by the Guardian – of an explosive book on the Trump White House by the journalist Michael Wolff.\\nThe former White House strategist and Trump campaign manager was a key source for the book, in which he was quoted as calling a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York City between Trump aides including Donald Trump Jr and presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner “treasonous”, “unpatriotic” and “bad shit”.\\nThe Trump aides believed the Russians at the meeting had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate for president.\\n“The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor – with no lawyers,” Bannon is quoted as saying in Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.\\n“They didn’t have any lawyers. Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it’s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately.”\\nBannon also gave a prescription for how such a meeting should have been set up and said he believed the Russians would likely have been introduced to Donald Trump.\\n“The chance that Don Jr did not walk these jumos up to his father’s office on the 26th floor is zero,” he said.\\nBannon also predicted to Wolff that special counsel Robert Mueller would focus his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election on money-laundering.\\nThe Trump White House was “sitting on a beach trying to stop a category five” hurricane, he said, adding that Mueller’s investigators would “crack Don Jr like an egg on national TV”.\\nIn the ensuing explosion of controversy, in which Wolff’s portrayal of White House aides’ doubts about Trump’s capacity for the job loomed large, Trump disavowed “Sloppy Steve” and argued there was no evidence of collusion between his presidential campaign and operatives tied to Russian president Vladimir Putin.\\nBannon rowed back, saying his remarks about the “treasonous” meeting had only referred to Paul Manafort, his predecessor in charge of the Trump campaign who is one of four aides indicted by Mueller. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to money-laundering charges.\\nBannon, who also told Wolff he knows no Russians, would not be a witness in any investigations, would not hire a lawyer and would not appear on national television answering questions, recently retained the same lawyer being used by former Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House general counsel Don McGahn.\\nBannon is scheduled to testify before the House panel on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the committee’s plans not authorized to discuss private committee deliberations and speaking to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\\nNeither Bannon nor his lawyer responded to requests by the AP for comment.\\nHow Bannon turned on Trump … and where the nationalist right goes next Read more\\nRussian election meddling is being investigated by Mueller, who was appointed by the justice department after Trump fired FBI director James Comey, and panels from both houses of Congress.\\nBannon, who left the White House in August 2017, has so far avoided the scrutiny of congressional investigators, who have instead focused on trying to secure interviews with top witnesses like Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.\\nBut Bannon played a critical role in the campaign, the presidential transition and the White House – all now under scrutiny from congressional investigators looking for evidence of a connection between Trump’s operations and Russia.\\nThe final result of the House investigation could be marred by partisan infighting.

Alex Wong/Getty Images\\nPresident Donald Trump was angry Sunday morning following a long, deeply reported piece in the Washington Post that claimed Chief of Staff John Kelly no longer has the power he once did inside the White House. The Post “is far more fiction than fact,” the president wrote. “Story after story is made up garbage—more like a poorly written novel than good reporting.” Trump then added flatly that the paper’s story on Kelly “isn’t true” and amounts to “just another hit job!”\\nThe Washington Post is far more fiction than fact. Story after story is made up garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting. Always quoting sources (not names), many of which don’t exist. Story on John Kelly isn’t true, just another hit job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2018\\nThis marks only the president’s latest attack against the paper, and its owner, Jeff Bezos. But the president is going to have to attack more than the Post to dismiss the story about a chief of staff in peril, considering it has become something of a theme. The clashes between Kelly and the president are “recurring and escalating,” wrote the Post. “Both his credibility and his influence have been severely diminished.”\\nAlthough Kelly was once seen as the man who could bring order to the White House, he is increasingly being left out of key decisions. And he no longer has the trust and support of some of the key members of Trump’s staff. The Post even notes he once angered First Lady Melania Trump. This is all par for the course when it comes to Trump’s White House. The Post explains:\\nKelly is the latest high-profile example of a West Wing Icarus — swept high into Trump’s orbit, only to be singed and cast low. Nearly everyone who has entered the White House has emerged battered — rendered a punchline (former press secretary Sean Spicer), a Justice Department target (former national security adviser Michael Flynn) or a diminished shell, fired by presidential tweet (former secretary of state Rex Tillerson). No one knows how many days remain for Kelly, but when he leaves — either by the president’s hand or because of his own mounting frustration — he is almost certain to limp away damaged.\\nThe Post is hardly alone in its assessment. Shortly before the paper published its story, Axios reported that Kelly threatened to quit on March 28 after a loud argument in an Oval Office meeting. “Very few people inside this White House feel secure or satisfied, given the wild, unpredictable mood and policy changes of Trump,” noted Axios’ Jonathan Swan. “Kelly months ago restored some order and sanity to the place but most of that is gone.”\\nEarlier in the week, the Associated Press also pointed out that Kelly “has receded from view, his clout diminished, his word less-trusted by staff and his guidance less tolerated by an increasingly go-it-alone president.” Trump is so frustrated by Kelly that he has even speculated about whether he could get rid of the chief of staff job entirely\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

It was “more than catastrophic”, they said.\\n“As victims of crime, we are all entitled to have an explanation when an alleged injustice has occurred. But this has been sinister, calculating, and those implicated must now face the full rigour of the criminal justice system.”\\n“These horrifying, shameful, unforgivable actions need to be disclosed in a criminal court for a jury to decide. Only then can we put our loved ones to rest.”\\nThey described the lockdown, for 11 years, of the release of findings of a 2002 inquiry, as “an abuse by powers of the almighty”. They added: “The Department of Health and its chief medical officer ignored those serious findings and continued to put patient safety at the bottom of the pile.”\\nThey described as “at best incompetent” a Hampshire police investigation, triggered by a “whistleblower” providing 1991 documentation “highlighting a culture that Dr [Jane] Barton [the GP accuses of prescribing deadly doses of painkillers to patients] had bought to the hospital”. The CPS’s failure to secure convictions was “devastating”.\\n'Disregard for human life': Gosport hospital inquiry's key findings Read more\\nEven more criticism was heaped on the inquests held into the deaths of 10 of the victims, with Barton and the nursing team afforded “top barristers” while relatives “had to fight for our legal representation coming on board at the 11th hour”.\\nDocumentation was “redacted or simply removed” to ensure jurors did not get the whole picture, the statement said. “And, whilst they [jury] did still manage to conclude that the drugs administered were inappropriate, without logic, unjustifiable and shortened life,” the relatives were angered that the jury concluded they were given for “therapeutic purposes”.\\nOf the “defective” GMC hearing, which did not strike Barton off the medical register, “that proved to us all that they are simply not fit for purpose”.\\nRelatives had been treated with contempt throughout, they said. “Every government body and or quango locked together, with no chance of objectivity, impartiality and, ultimately, the truth.” There had been “inequality of arms” to stop families achieving justice, and regulatory bodies appeared to “do whatever they want”.\\nKnowing that complaints had been made the police in 1998 would have caused “outrage” if it had been made public at the time. “None of us would have allowed out loved ones to be admitted to Gosport War Memorial hospital had we known there was an ongoing police investigation.”\\nVictims\\nElsie Devine, 88, Reeve’s grandmother, like others, died after the inappropriate administration of opioids, whose prescription was not in the best interests of the patient. She had been admitted for rehabilitation with kidney problems. Like many others she was “opioid-naive”, ie not chronically receiving opioid analgesics on a daily basis. She was given diamorphine and midazolam two days before her death in 1999. “My seven-stone grandmother, who did not have dementia and was recovering from a kidney infection, was pinned to the floor by four nurses and given enough drugs to lay out a 6ft violent man,” Reeves recently told the Sunday Times.\\nGladys Richards , 91, who had dementia and lived in a nursing home, was admitted for rehabilitation on 17 August 1998 after fracturing her hip. She died four days later. Her daughter, Gillian MacKenzie, now 84, was the first relative to raise the alarm. “When I had contacted the police and said I wanted an appointment with somebody over an allegation of unlawful killing, I was told: “There there, my dear. You’re upset,” she told the BBC. Fighting for justice had taken over her life.\\nArthur Cunningham, known as Brian, 79, was a widower with Parkinson’s disease and dementia, but was admitted for treatment for a pressure sore in September 1998. The former wartime fighter pilot died five days later. “He went in to be treated for bedsores. There’s no way he was near death,” his stepson Charles Farthing, told the Sunday Times. He was also opioid naïve. He was given a three-fold increase in pain relief three days before his death., the report said. The inquiry stated the hospital notes recorded relatives were anxious about the treatment.\\nRobert Wilson, 74, who died in 1998 was meant to be receiving rehabilitation after fracturing a shoulder, and was another the inquiry panel assessed had been administered opioids without appropriate clinical indication. He had told his family he was being drugged to death. “Help me, they’re killing me,” he begged his son Iain Wilson.\\n“I said, “No they’re not, Dad. They’re trying to do the best for you,” Wilson told the Sunday Times. “When I went in the following day, he was in a coma.” He added: “How I wish now I’d trust my instincts and got him out.”\\nStan Carby, 65, a former naval officer, died in 1999 within 24 hours of being admitted to rehabilitation following a series of mini-strokes. His daughter, Cindy Grant, said he was expected to be home in a couple of weeks and relatives had seen him at 10.30pm the night before, when he was in “good spirits”. The next morning he was in a coma. When they asked Barton if he was going to die, she said: “Well, you’ve got to just let nature takes its course,” Grant told Radio 4’s Today programme. “He wasn’t in there to die. He was in there to get better,” said Grant.\\nPeggy Coates, 76, transferred from another hospital for rehabilitation after a stroke on June 2 1999. She died on 15 July , on the day she was given the first and high dose of diamorphine, the report said. The plan had been for her to return home, it said, so it was not clear why, on her admission, Barton wrote in the hospital notes: “Please make comfortable.....I am happy for my staff to confirm death.”\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

The news outlet, quoting industry officials briefed on the broad outline of the plan, said the Trump administration is considering an inquiry to justify up to a 25 percent tariff on auto imports, which totaled $176 billion in 2017. That‘s exponentially larger than the imports of about $30 billion for steel and $18 billion for aluminum.\\nMorning Transportation newsletter A daily speed read on transportation and infrastructure — in your inbox.

Thirteen, soon to be 14 companies, produced nearly 12 million cars and trucks in America last year. To our knowledge, no one is asking for this protection. This path leads inevitably to fewer choices and higher prices for cars and trucks in America.”\\nOn Wednesday morning, Trump indicated some action is coming on autos, although it was unclear whether he was referring to ongoing talks with China, NAFTA negotiations with Canada and Mexico or something else.\\n\"There will be big news coming soon for our great American Autoworkers. After many decades of losing your jobs to other countries, you have waited long enough!\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\\nTrump appeared to link a potential action on autos with NAFTA talks when he told reporters later on Wednesday that he felt the auto industry would “be very happy with what’s going to happen.”\\n“You\\'ll be seeing very soon what I\\'m talking about,” he said before his trip to Long Island. “NAFTA is very difficult. Mexico has been very difficult to deal with. Canada has been very difficult to deal with. They have been taking advantage of the United States for a long time. I am not happy with their requests. But I will tell you, in the end, we win. We will win, and we\\'ll win big.”\\nTrump has already imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum after a Commerce Department investigation determined that current imports of both metals were large enough to threaten the long-term viability of both domestic industries, thereby putting U.S. national security at risk. Any new inquiry would also rely on the so-called Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, a, gives the executive branch the ability to conduct investigations to “determine the effects on the national security of imports.”\\nLast year, the U.S. imported $43 billion worth of cars from Canada, $39 billion from Japan, $30 billion from Mexico, $21 billion from Germany, $16 billion from South Korea and additional amounts from other suppliers.\\nThe White House, Commerce Department and Office of the U.S. Trade Representative did not respond to requests for comment.\\nAdam Behsudi contributed to this report.\\n\\n### Response:\\n1.

They argue that the NHS workforce is \"facing a crisis\" with shortages of key staff.\\nThe chief executives of the King\\'s Fund, the Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation have come together to make a joint submission to Downing Street ahead of the much-anticipated long-term plan for the NHS promised by Theresa May.\\nA policy aimed at limiting the number of skilled workers from outside the EU has been criticised by employers. An annual cap of 20,700 has led to thousands of workers, including NHS staff, being denied visas.\\nThe BBC revealed that visas for 100 Indian doctors had been refused. They had been offered short-term contracts as part of a long-running scheme in the north-west of England that provides junior doctors to more than 20 NHS trusts.\\nAnother BBC investigation showed that genetic counsellors, who identify people at risk of hereditary cancer and other serious conditions, were being turned down for visas even though there were workforce shortages.\\nImage copyright JEFF OVERS/BBC\\nThe Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, has said he will review the visa system for skilled workers, after lobbying by some cabinet ministers. He told the BBC\\'s Andrew Marr programme he was aware of the difficulties with NHS recruitment.\\n\"I see the problem with that. It is something I\\'m taking a fresh look at,\" he said.\\nThe think tanks\\' joint letter says there are \"worrying shortages of nurses, GPs and hospital doctors\". It adds: \"There is no option but to recruit more staff from overseas and to relax controls on visas.\\n\"Nurses and some other health professionals, like radiographers, are on a shortage-occupation list, which means they are given priority in allocation of visas.\\n\"But most doctors are not. And there has been a campaign by health employers to put all medical jobs on the shortage list or to take all NHS jobs temporarily out of the visa system.\"\\nThe think tank Global Future has produced analysis looking at the extent to which the NHS relies on overseas workers.\\nIt says:\\nIn the NHS in England, which employs about 1.2 million people in total, one in eight of those staff who have a known nationality - 12.5% - are from overseas\\nNHS staff in clinical roles are much more likely to come from abroad. About a quarter of doctors and 16% of nurses and health visitors are from overseas\\nUp to 45% of staff in some vital NHS specialties, including cardio-thoracic surgeons, paediatric cardiologists and neurosurgeons, are from outside the UK\\nLonger term, the lobbyists say, there needs to be a 10-year workforce strategy. And this must be given top priority and go \"hand-in-hand\" with the new funding settlement. They also call for real-terms funding increases of 4% per year. Anything less, they say, will compromise patient care and delay critical repairs to hospital buildings.\\nNHS leaders, in what looks like a planned campaign, have united behind the 4% per year figure. They fear that anything closer to 3%, which ministers may want to trumpet as a significant boost to NHS finances, won\\'t allow any improvement to current shortcomings in the system, such as rising waiting lists.\\nThey are up against the Treasury, which has wider issues to deal with in the public finances.\\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies has noted that making a chunky new investment in the NHS will have to be accommodated in the government\\'s plan to balance the books by the mid-2020s.\\n\"Unless it is able and willing to implement tax rises or further cuts to the social security budget over the rest of this Parliament, it is hard to see how a significant injection of additional cash into the NHS would be consistent with the government\\'s stated fiscal objective,\" it says.\\nThe uncertainty over the path of the economy and future borrowing requirements, adds the IFS, will make the Treasury even more cautious.\\nExpectation around the government\\'s long-term NHS funding plan has been growing by the day.\\nAnd now added to the calls for higher year-on-year spending are the demands for changes to immigration rules for health workers.
